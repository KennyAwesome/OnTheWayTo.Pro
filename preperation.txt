Those who feel overwhelmed by life might appreciate the following words:
"Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards."
Those who seek to understand might appreciate the following statement:
"Creativity is the ability to introduce order into the randomness of nature."
Those who seek to understand order might appreciate these words:
"I think order depends more on preparation than control."
Those who seek to understand why that is might appricate the following three steps:
Firstly, to understand why order depends less on control one might appreciate these words:
"The more we value things outside our control, the less control we have."
Those who seek to know what it is which seeks control might appreciate the following realization:
"Control is an imaginary boundary the ego thinks it's in charge of."
Those who seek to understand the ego might appreciate the following following words:
"The ego doesn't know that the source of all energy is within you, so it seeks it outside."
Those who seek control within oneself might appreciate the following explaination:
"Ego means self-identification with thinking, to be trapped in thought, which means to have a mental image of 'me' based on thought and emotions. So ego is there in the absence of a witnessing presence."
One might find utility of ego in a state of short term survival as in:
"The ego's job is to kill everything but itself."
Thus any attempt to witness and testification of one's own ego might trigger the defence mechanis of the ego as in:
"If your ego is hurt you may become angry. Understand that ego itself is a disease. Dissolve your ego as far as possible. If you have inferiority complex, or have a very deficient ego you will loose your temper very easily."
Those who seek to dissolve their ego, might appreciate these words:
"Quick success builds ego, slow success builds character."
Those who seek to build such character, might appreciate the chapters "character" and "patience".
Those who seek to understand, why such defence mechanism is triggered, might appreciate these words:
"Safety is the most basic task of all. Without the sense of safety, no growth can take place. Without safety, all energy goes to defence."
Thus those who seek long term surival might appreciate the following proverb:
"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."
Those who seek to go far might appreciate the following realization:
"Strategy is choice. Strategy means saying no to certain kinds of things."
Thus one might regain control for long term surival by saying "no" to the react impulsively to defend one's own ego.
Those who struggle to resist that impulse might appreciate the chapter on "responsibility".
One might then be able to understand the following statement:
"Confidence is essential, but ego is not."
Secondly, to understand the importance of preperation one might appreciate these words:
"Confidence comes from being prepared."
Those who seek to understand why that might be, might appreciate these words:
"He who is best prepared can best serve his moment of inspiration."
Those who seek such moment, might appreciate the explaination on stategy:
"Tactics is knowing what to do, when there is something to do. Strategy is knowing what to do when there is nothing to do."
Those who do not know what to do when there is nothing to do might appreciate these words:
"Strategy is not the consequence of planning, but the opposite: its starting point."
Those who do not know how to start planning might appreciate these words:
"Planning is bringing the future into the present."
Those who get too attached to a plan might appreciate the following warning:
"Plans are useless, but planning is essential."
One might find a reason for why plans are useless in these words:
"No amount of guilt can change the past and no amount of worrying can change the future."
Those who seek to change the future might appreciate these words:
"Realize deeply that the present moment is all you will ever have."
Those who seek to use one's own present moment to prepare might appreciate the following limited enumeration for a possible cause of one's cause death:

	- Renewable or sustainable power sources
	- Fortification of existing power grid
	- Efforts to sustain offgrid life style
	- Solar Flares:

		- Have spare parts inside a EMP proof casing

	- Talk to someone who listens compassionately.
Thirdly those who seek to understand order might find a clue in the following proverb:
"Order is half of the rent."
Those who are creative might wonder, what would be the other half would be,  if it was not the obvious implication of money.
One might dare to guess that it might be be stability, if stability would be defined as the execution of order.
One might then be able to define order as the "knowledge of the patterns resulting in stability".
One might find one reason for it given the natural inclination of the organ called "brain" to recognize patterns.
One might then be able to define stablity as the absence of chaos as in:
"The Daoist answer is right on the line, where you have one foot in order so that you're fairly stable, and you have another foot in chaos so that new and interesting and compelling and transforming things are happening to you."
Those who seek such transformation might appreciate these words:
"Creativity is a habit, and the best creativity is a result of good work habits."
Those who seek such good habits might appreciate the chapter on "originality".
Those who are overwhelmed with the infinite ways to prepare might appreciate the words:
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
Those who seek a simple habit to prepare oneself for the future might appreciate the following mantra:
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
