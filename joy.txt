The understanding of the concept of "happiness" may vary,
but the essence would be mostly the same,
which is the blissful state in which all needs are satisfied.
But it is a state which is very difficult to reach in a world,
which is flooded with contradicting informations.
One may to resort to science, but given the subjective nature of the topic,
one might be still left confused.
The following document should be read critically with caution,
to avoid the temptation of hedonism.
One may find a certain degree of happiness,
while addressing each layer of "hierarchy of needs" one by one bottom up,
mentioned in the same named book.
While doing so, one may wonder what "joy" would be,
for those the following quote might be insightful:
"Next to doing a good job yourself,
the greatest joy is having someone else do a first class job
under your direction."
Eventhough it might encourage some to become a dictator, 
one might also realize something good - the essence of joy.
Which is that one may feel joy through action,
because during action one can reach the state of "flow",
in which one is able to forget ones own suffering without 
self destructive hedonism.
One might then realize that one might be able to feel
happiness and joy at the same time,
while adressing ones own needs consciously:
The highest need in the mentioned "hierarchy of needs"
is called "self transcendence",
which was found later in the notes of the author of that book.
What was referred to as in the mentioned quote
"someone else do a first class job under your direction" 
could be understood as "self transcendence",
which might be the very reason why the author called it "the greatest joy",
because it is indeed adressing one's own need of "self transcendence".
For those who desires to do it right away,
one should only offer what is abundant,
because the world operates with the following principle
described well as in:
"You take what you can get and hold on tight to it -
by any means necessary.
After all you only live once."
For those suffering because they think they have nothing to offer,
one might appreciate the chance to give them the following mantra:
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
