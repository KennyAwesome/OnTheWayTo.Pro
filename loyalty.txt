[Todo integrate to a different chapter]

Those who seek to move on might be confronted with the following situation:
"It’s easy to be a naive idealist. It’s easy to be a cynical realist.
It’s quite another thing to have no illusions and still hold the inner flame."
Those whose "inner flame" is already out might find a way to reignite in these words:
"In everyone’s life, at some time, our inner fire goes out.
It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being."
One might find such a being by saying this mantra:
"We are all on the way to Pro."
