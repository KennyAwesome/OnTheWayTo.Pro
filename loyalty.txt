One might aspire to love as in the following statement:
"There is nothing more truly artistic than to love people"
Those who do not know how to live might appreciate the following quote:
"Trust is the first step to love."
Those who trust might appreciate the following warning:
"Trust but verify."
Those who seek to verify might appreciate the following advice:   
"The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them."
Those who become hesitatant might understand one reason why they might hesitate in these words:
"Trust takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair."
Those who seek to prevent such break might appreciate the following warning:
"Trust is earned, respect is given, and loyalty is demonstrated. Betrayal of any one of those is to lose all three."
Those who struggle from such betrayal might appreciate the following explaination:
"Forgiveness is not something we do for other people. It’s something we do for ourselves to move on."
Those who seek to move on might be confronted with the following situation:
"It’s easy to be a naive idealist. It’s easy to be a cynical realist.
It’s quite another thing to have no illusions and still hold the inner flame."
Those whose "inner flame" is already out might find a way to reignite in these words:
"In everyone’s life, at some time, our inner fire goes out.
It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being."
One might find such a being by saying this mantra:
"We are all on the way to Pro."
