Disclaimer:
This is not a last farewell for the author.
The author wants to farewell a friend,
who has helped him understand the mystery of life a litte more.

One might find oneself looking for way to express
all the overwhelming emotions
which could break out any moment.
One might be even fortunate enough to find a
"causality" for those overwhelming emotions.
If that "causality" is in fact a heart felt human emotion,
one cannot call oneself an artist,
if one would not try to express all the unexpressed emotions.
If one finds oneself left alone,
one might find appreciation in friendship.
The human concept of "friendship" may vary from individuals,
but one which kept humanity so far alive is as simple as
an oath sworn to each other by sharing a drink together
to a toast word with the meaning of "love":
"Aoi"
For an artist to count as a friend,
one need to recognize and admire the commitment.
For those so wants contribute to an existing friendship,
one might aprreciate the offer
to personally deliver the creations to other friends for them.
One can only hope to find an artist whom one can call a friend,
but for those who has not
the following mantra might come in handy:
"We are all on the way to Pro."
