All suggestions for improvement for a government is fictional and is not an appell for a rebellion.

Some one once said:
"We cannot protect our children from life.
Therefore, it is essential that we prepare them for it."
Humanity has so far relied on governments for protection
as stated in:
"Government exists to protect us from each other.
Where government has gone beyond its limits is
in deciding to protect us from ourselves."
One of the many reason why humanity requires a government,
might be the absence of an official answer to the following question:
"There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide."
Since an official answer requires an objective truth,
which is not possible given the understanding of anthropocentrism,
the following realization might be helpful to define being alive as good:
"I think life's an irrational obsession."
But this realization will probably not stop the government as stated in:
"A good deal of tyranny goes by the name of protection."
The first step might be found as in:
"You can never protect yourself 100%.
What you do is protect yourself as much as possible and
mitigate risk to an acceptable degree.
You can never remove all risk."
Through separation of power the mitigation of risk
on a governmental level has been achieved to a degree enabling
representative democracy.
But as someone realized:
"It is insufficient to protect ourselves with laws;
we need to protect ourselves with mathematics."
Artificial Intelligence (AI) uses statistical models based in mathematics and
D5.txt proposes an AI-based solution approach to further reducing corruption,
capitalistic lobbyism and suboptimal decision based on irrational opinion.
Such a system would be essential for the full operation of Artsylum,
but as realized in:
"It is impossible to design a system so perfect that no one needs to be good." 
It has been established in malevolence.txt that there will be people,
who will refuse to be a benevolent artist expressing their Ultimate Art.
In that case, one may appreciate the advice to increase one's own capacity for compassion to leave the decision up to that malevolent individual,
whether to stay in captive isolation or exile themselves to the outside of Artsylum.
One may concluded that a government needs to be capable of
hold all malevolent individuals in captive isolation,
until that individual decides whether to stay or be exiled.
A government should be merciful to allow reentry to the captive isolation ,
and only after extensive rehabilitating therapy be allowed to join other artists freely.
The reentry can only be initiated by voluntarily entering a fully automated capturing system.
No effort should be held back to minimize the risk for lethal accidents
caused by the automated capturing system and automated defence system against those who have been exiled.
The reason why such an automated capturing system is necessary is that
no one should be forced to inflict violence upon malevolent individuals,
which would defeat the purpose of a government.
But if an artist voluntarily captures such an individual
according to the situational analysis,
one is advised to appreciate that action of violence with forgiveness.
If one is under the suspicion of being malevolent,
one needs to enter the automatic capturing system voluntarily.
If one suspects others of being malevolent,
one needs to enter and stay in a separate automatic capturing system as well,
until the claim has been proven valid.
If one has been falsely claimed by the automatic system as malevolent and has been captured,
one should have enough wisdom to accept and forgive the system and
should not neglect the effort to improve that system,
to prevent the same error from happening again by reminding oneself as in:
"A mistake is only an error.
It becomes a mistake when you fail to correct it."
Those who seek the courage to correct one's own mistake
might appreciate the following mantra:
"We are all on the way to Pro."
