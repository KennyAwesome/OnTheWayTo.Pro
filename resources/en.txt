Disclaimer: Trigger warning regarding the topics such as mental health, science, metaphysics and politics.
For all the other legal disclaimers please refer to the chapter "disclaimer".

One might appreciate to begin reading the clarification of the intention of the first author of this document. The reference to the first author will further be abbreviated to just "author" for simplicity. The main purpose of this document is to offer a series of definitions on controversal terms in order to provide the consensus that "peace might be good" to which as many as possible could agree upon in order to achieve long-term world peace.    
The motivation of for the author to start writing this document originates in the struggles which the author has been confronted in general during the period of adolencence. To deal with the overwhelming sensation of sadness, the author came up with the idea of a robot which would be able to console the author as in:   
"Art is to console those who are broken by life."    
In the quest of it's implementation, which the author refers to as "art", the author realized that consolation consists of not only in verbal, such as words of encouragement, but also of non-verbal communication, such as hugs and nodding. With the advancement in the field of robotics, there has been documentations on robots which can nod and hug. But the generation of words, which can actually console the author, has not been generated. With the popularization of "large languange models" used for "retrieval argumented generation" it has became possible to find and rephrase specific sentences from a document. The moment the author realized that such systems could be used to inspire the courage to keep on living, the author decided to create such a document, which would contain sentences, which would be beneficial to console the author and maybe even others. The author realized early on that it would be very difficult to generate such words of encouragement with only large languange models, due to the lack of understanding of human nature. Given the multicultural background of the author, the author was fascinated by quotes of people, in a sense of quoting the master with the intention of honor or the art form referenced as "bonmot", which is to make a one-line remark which could not be more consise. The author realized during the writing process that quoting could result in unfavorable legal consequences, if published officially. Thus the author is working on reformulating the quotes, but has not completely done so. The author is working on refomulating those which do not belong to the public domain, but the author appreciates the understanding that the capacity of the author is limited to reformulate all of the quote at the point of writing. The author further appreciates all the collaborative effort to improve this document. The requirements to recognize a contribution as a "improvement" can be found in the chapter "feedback". Furthermore the author realized that in order to console others that it might require to find the right words at the right time. In order to achieve that the author is building a retrieval augumented generation system which would retrieve the adequate words if requested. The author also realized that the perspective of the author alone would be limited thus seek to offer a way for everyone to keep improving this document which will be moderated by the very system used to retrieve such words.
This process is commonly refered in the field of information technology as "continuous integration" which is also referred in the subtitle of this document. The main title "42" of this document is inspired by the following passage from a book called "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" uttered by a fictional machine:   
"The ultimate answer to life, the universe and everything is...42!"   
The author is well aware of the arbitrarity nature of that number in that mentioned quote is expressed with the intention of humor.
The author was intreagued by the idea to explore the possibility to make that answer come true. The author realized that there was a way to make that sentence true, which is to create a document with the title "42" containing 42 chapters trying to define what such "the ultimate answer to life" might be. The author is well aware, that providing an absolute answer is not possible, as postulated in the philosophical idea of "relativism". One might appreciate the clarification of the author that the author does not claim that this document contains "the ultimate answer to life" in an objective sense, but that it is rather an effort to create a mental and technological framework, which might offer the words which one might be accepted as an "answer". The author refuses to keep guessing what such answer could be, thus the author seeks to keep improving this document. Another reason why this document only contains 42 chapters is to maintain readablity for humans such as the author and some of the readers. It might be worth mentioning that this art project contains more than 42 chapters to not to impose unnecesary restriction upon the creative writing process. The selection by the author of the 42 chapters can be found in the chapter "index". The selection will be made by the first author until the author is content with the choice made by automatic selection system. The name of the mentioned selection system is called "Aoi", which is a word pronounciable by most of the future human users, because it does not contain any consonants which might be hard to pronounce for some. Details of Aoi can be found in the chapter "requirements".
The author further intents to create and operate an non profit organization called "Voice Of Humanity", which overall goal is to ensure the correct operation of a anonymous collaboration platform called "D5" to find solutions to achieve and maintain world peace.
Details are described in the chapters "foundation", "humanity" and "D5".
Those who seek to contribute might find details about occasions to meet the author in person in the chapter "events".
To minimize confusion one might appreciate the chapter "index" for the recommended reading order by the author, but one might also appreciate the freedom to explore it on their own accord.   
   
The author wants to express gratitude of all the ancestors and fellows who made this document possible.

"Most people want to avoid pain, and discipline is usually painful."
Those who struggle with such pain, might appreciate these words:   
"Pain is weakness leaving your body."    
Those who struggle excessively with such pain, might appreciate the following insight:   
"Pain is a self protection mechanism of the body to recognize and avoid external stimulus which could destroy our body."   
Its calibration is relative, meaning through consistent progressive overload it can be conditioned to endure such stimulus which the untrained body would have broken down under.
But one might appreciate to understand that it might require knowledge not to overstimulate the body to de degree of damage, as already mentioned as "discipline that is excessive".
One might also realize that the lack of such stimulation leads to the deterioration of one's own body deteriorates and thus becomes weaker.

# 2. unity   
   

One might find oneself suffering from their attachment to individuality as in:    
"But as long as one continues to use one's misfortune to one's advantage in order to be 'special', one will always need that misfortune."    
Those who are still in need of attachment to their misfortune, might be fortunate enough to find such fellow individuals along that path who might be able to empathize as in:   
"Shared joy is double joy; shared sorrow is half sorrow."   
Those who might still feel a sense of alienation, regardless wether one's sorrows have been reduced or not, might still feel a sense of alienation as in:
"Distance isn't the amount of miles between us, it's the amount of things we don't say to each other."    
Those who might then seek to reduce such a sense of alienation, might appreciate these words:   
"Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose."   
One might appreciate to know one reason one might confuse unity with sameness is because sameness could be rephrased as "uniformity" which sounds similar. Those who then wonder what such purpose could be might appreciate these words:   
"Unity without the gospel is a worthless unity."   
One might appreciate one reason why that might be in these words:
"Unity, to be real, must stand the severest strain without breaking."
There has been attempts of numerous "religous gospels" which all claim to seek unity but has yet not achieved unite, especially with those who claim to be rational. There has been further efforts by those who claim to be rational with "scientific gospel", which has also yet to achieve unity with those who they might refer to as "irrational". Some might be wise enough to recognize one's own limitation of rationality as in:   
"I think life’s an irrational obsession."   
One might then be able to appreciate the idea that the mentioned "oneness of purpose" could be to "love". Those who seek to understand "love" might appreciate the chapter "transcendence". Those who seek to understand such "irrational obsession" might appreciate the chapter "mission". One might then remember that forcing such definition upon others might encounter resistance and cause discord. One might then realize that one needs to realize that such definition might be good for oneself on their own. Those who seek to realize such insight might appreciate the chapter "realization". Those who seek to understand what good might be, might appreciate the chapters "good", "malevolence" and "needs".

"Inclusion is the celebration of diversity put into action."   
Those who seek such a way to act might appreciate these words:   
"Inclusion is not tolerance it is unquestioned acceptance."   
Those who are vulnable of their own naivity might appreciate the chapters "integrity", "loyalty", "maturity" and "normal" first. Those seek such unquestioned acceptance of others, but yet struggle to accept others might appreciate these words:   
"We don’t heal in isolation, but in community."   
One might understand one reason why that is in these words:   
"Emotional connection is crucial to healing. In fact, trauma experts overwhelmingly agree that the best predictor of the impact of any trauma is not the severity of the event, but whether we can seek and take comfort from others."   
Those who are hesitant to seek and take such comfort from others might appreciate the words:   
"People are afraid to heal because their entire identity is centered around the trauma they’ve experienced. They have no idea who they are outside of trauma and that unknown is terrifying."   
Some might struggle to confront such unknown as in:   
"Overexplaining is a trauma response."   
Those might appreciate the following advice:   
"Don’t explain your philosophy. Embody it."   
Those who seek to embody such a philosophy might appreciate the following mantra:   
"We might be all on the way to Pro."

"Nobody cares about me."    
Those who seek to be cared for, might appreciate these words:   
"You stop being a child when you realize the world isn’t here to cater to your wants and needs."

"To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a child."
Those who seek to remain such a child, might appreciate these words:    
"Stupidity is the deliberate cultivation of ignorance."    
Those who seek to understand why one might not want keep cultivating such ignorance, might appreciate these words:   
"The difference between courage and stupidity is measured by success and survival."   
Those who then seek to surive, might then be able to recognize the utility of a document called "hierarchy of needs" despite some critisim. Those who seek to understand one's own needs might appreciate the subjective interpretation and explaination by the author of this document.
One might appreciate to know that the author of the mentioned document had the idea in midst of the rising of a capitalistic society. That author tried to explain the "non-materialistic" needs beyond the physiological needs, which is food, water, rest and warmth.
Those who struggle to address one's own physiological needs might appreciate the chapter on "peace", "good", "privilege", "mission" and "health". That author might have explicitly mentioned warmth, because shelter would be a need one level higher in the hierarchy, which is security. To address the need for securiry one might appreciate the following enumeration of possible examples of a job with prospect until artsylum is fully operational, long term contract for renting a room, emergency savings, insurance, etc..
Those who seek such security might appreciate the chapter on "malevolence" and "preperation". After those two materialistic needs are satisfied, one might have enough capacity to explore the need for "friendship and belonging". There is no general order in which those needs should be adressed, but one can decrease the amount of unnessecary suffering, by taking one step at a time.
Those who seek a place where one might be able to call as "home", might appreciate the chapters "home", "protection", "friendship", "honor", "humor", "civilization" and "asylum".
To prepare oneself for that occasion of emergency, one should not neglect building up "esteem". One might appreciate the following subjective understanding of the author for "esteem". Esteem might be the recognition of ones own integrity by others whether one will not hesitate to help when such help is requested. Those who struggle with hesitatation might appreciate the chapter "clarity", "integrity" and "obituary". At that stage, one might be pondering how to be regarded in "high esteem". One of the most simple ways to do might be to practive a martial arts to be able to protect those in need. One might appreciate a belt system often preverent in styles of martial arts originating in Asia as a sign of recognition of one's proficiency and maturity by others. One might appreciate the warning, that such display of achievement and hierarchy might be abused to claim authority over others leading to harm. Those who seek to prepare against such abuse of power, might appreciate the chapter on "malevolence". Those who might be tempted to abuse their power, might appreciate the following realization:   
"True humility is not in the absence of confidence but strength restrained."   
Those who seek to understand strength might appreciate the chapter on "character". Those who seek to understand the need for such restriction might appreciate the chapters "harmony" and "hero". One might appreciate the advice not to remain in convenient complaisance only because one has reached the maximal possible capability in one domain of life.  One is rather encouraged to maximalize other capacities to explore the limits of one's own possiblity. In it's ultimate state it might be possible to be regarded as "self actualization". One might then appreciate the wisdom that it might not be possible to maximize all capacities in one finite life time. Those who have not realized the finitude of one's own life might appreciate the following wisdom:    
"We all have two lives. The second one starts when we realize that we only have one."   
Those who struggle to start that second life might appreciate the following words of compassion:   
"You are enough. You are so enough, it is unbelievable how enough you are."   
Those who struggle to believe in oneself to be enough might appreciate the chapter on "contentment". Those who seek to start such a second life might have such painful realization of "Weltschmerz", directly translatable to "world pain", which might be able to be defined as following:   
"Weltschmerz, basically, is the depression we feel when bamboozlers, fanatics, manipulators, trolls, bigots, demagogues, fear-mongers, liars and prigs threaten to take over the world, and there’s nothing, we think, we can do about it."    
Those who are still suffering from "Weltschmerz" might appreciate the chapter on "hope", "meaning", and "mission". Those who seek to overcome one's own "Weltschmerz" through changing one's own thoughts might appreciate the realization that that exact desire might be the final layer of the hierarchy of needs called "self transcendance". That desire to contribute to reduce the suffering of oneself and others might be referred to as "love" as in the following quote:   
"Love is the desire to give, not to receive, something."   
Those who seek to understand "self transcendence" might appreicate the chapters "transcendence", "enlightenment", "consciousness", "responsiblity", "procreation" and "realization". Those who struggle to stop sacrificing oneself to almost a pathological degree might appreciate the chapter on "maturity". Those who seek to find a way to contribute to humanity without excessive self sacrifice might appreciate the chapters "ultimate", "normal", "mantra", "humanity", "prompt", "originality", "joy", "D5" and "foundation". Those who have already found their way to contribute might appreciate the following mantra to offer their help:   
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
   

# 4. curiosity   
   

One might find oneself struggling in a situation described in these words:

Those who seek to become more aware might appreciate the chapters  "consciousness" and "realization". Those who struggle with those who desire to sell them something, might appreciate the chapter on "asylum". Those who seek to understand such programming might appreciate the chapter on "harmony". Those seek to take further steps to maintain their autonomy but lack the motivation might appreciate these words:    
"The three things that motivate creative people - autonomy, mastery, purpose! Autonomy: the urge to direct our own lives. Mastery: the desire to get better and better at something that matters. Purpose: the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves. these are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses."    
Those who seek to understand mastery might appreciate the chapter on "ultimate". Those who seek tp understand purpose might appreciate the chapter on "meaning". Those who seek to understand autonomy might appreciate these words:   
"Autonomy is freedom to develop one's self - to increase one's knowledge, improve one's skills, and achieve responsibility for one's conduct. And it is freedom to lead one's own life, to choose among alternative courses of action so long as no injury to others results."   
Those who seek such freedom  might appreciate the chaper on "hope". Those who seek such knowledge might appreciate the chapter on "good".

"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them."  
Those who seek such new paths might appreciate these words:   
"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing."   
Those who seek to understand one of such reason for existing might appreciate these words:   
"Curiosity is the essence of human existence. 'Who are we? Where are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going?' I don’t know. I don’t have any answers to those questions. I don’t know what’s over there around the corner. But I want to find out."   
Those who seek to understand why it might be uniquely valuable to humans, might appreciate these words:   
"Once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight, or any experience that reveals the human spirit."   
Those who seek to understand the "human spirit" might appreciate these words:   
"Human spirit is the ability to face the uncertainty of the future with curiosity and optimism. It is the belief that problems can be solved, differences resolved. It is a type of confidence. And it is fragile. It can be blackened by fear and superstition."   
Those who seek to understand curiousity might appreciate these words:   
"Curiosity in children is but an appetite for knowledge."   
Those whose appetite for knowledge has decreased might appreciate these words:   
"It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education."   
Those who seek to understand where such might lead to, might appreciate these words:   
"The proper end of teaching is to lead our students toward autonomy."  
Those who seek to lead their students towards autonomy, might appreciate these words:   
"Teach principles not formulas."    
Those who seek to understand why teaching such principles might be important, might appreciate these words:    
"If you focus on principles, you empower everyone who understands those principles to act without constant monitoring, evaluating, correcting, or controlling."    
Those who seek such autonomy, might appreciate these words:   
"To reject revelational epistemology is to commit yourself to defending the truth of autonomous epistemology."   
One might appreciate the simplicity of the explaination of the term "epistemology" as following:   
"Epistemology is the study of knowledge. By what conduit do we know what we know?"   
One might appreciate the explaination of the term "revelational epistemology" as the conduit of gaining knowledge through some "supernatural sources" or "divinity" some might refer to as "god" or "gods". One who seek to reject such conduit might appreciate the explaination of "autonomous epistemology", which is the conduit of gaining knowledge through one's own experience as in:   
"Science is the systematic classification of experience."   
Those who seek to classify their own experience systematically might appreciate these words:   
"Whatever the measurement system is, it needs to be consistent, repeatable, and as unbiased as possible."   
Those who wonder why being entirely unbiased might not be possible might appreciate these words:   
"But epistemology is always and inevitably personal. The point of the probe is always in the heart of the explorer: What is my answer to the question of the nature of knowing?"   
Those who seek such an answer might appreciate these words:   
"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science."   
One might then be confronted with such an mysterious experience as in:   
"I am a mystery to myself."

"Most people are searching for happiness outside of themselves. That’s a fundamental mistake. Happiness is something that you are, and it comes from the way that you think."     
The understanding of the concept of "happiness" might vary, but one might be able to agree to the following consensus:   
"Happiness is the blissful state in which all needs are satisfied."    
Those who seek to understand such needs, might apreciate the chapter on "needs". One might then realize that such a state might be difficult to reach in a world, given the circumstances that one's source for knowledge might be full of contradicting misinformation. One might then try to resort to science, but given the subjective nature of the topic, one might be still left confused.    
One might appreciate to read following document with critically with caution, to avoid the temptation of hedonism, which could be defined as:    
"When enough is not enough, a Hedonist is born."    
One might then be able to find a certain degree of happiness, while addressing each layer of "hierarchy of needs" one by one bottom up, mentioned in the same named document.    
While doing so, one may wonder what "joy" would be, for those the following quote might be insightful:    
"Next to doing a good job yourself, the greatest joy is having someone else do a first class job under your direction."
Eventhough it might encourage some to become a tyrant,  one might also realize something good - the essence of joy. Which is that one might feel joy through action, because during action one can reach the state of "flow", in which one is able to forget ones own suffering without self destructive hedonism. One might then realize that one might be able to feel happiness and joy at the same time, while adressing ones own needs consciously:    
The highest need in the mentioned "hierarchy of needs" is called "self transcendence", which was found later in the notes of the author of that book. What was referred to as in the mentioned quote "someone else do a first class job under your direction"  could be understood as "self transcendence", which might be the very reason why the author called it "the greatest joy", because it is indeed adressing one's own need of "self transcendence".
For those who desires to do it right away, one should only offer what is abundant, because the world operates with the following principle described well as in:    
"You take what you can get and hold on tight to it - by any means necessary. After all you only live once."    
For those suffering because they think they have nothing to offer, one might appreciate the chance to give them the following mantra:   
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
   

# 10. privilege   
   

One might be fortunate enough to encounter a document called "Declaration of Human Rights" which starts as following:
"Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as [...]."
Those who might then wonder about the meaning of such "entitlement, might appreciate these words:   
"Entitlement is the belief that I am exempt from responsibility and I am owed special treatment."    
Those who might hold such a belief might appreciate the following warning:
"Entitlement and privelege corrupt."    
Those who might then wonder about the difference between such entitlement and privilege, might appreciate these words:    
"What separates privilege from entitlement is gratitude."    
Those who might then start to appreciate one's own privilege of being protected by our ancestors and kins, might appreciate the following insight:    
"We owe our children – the most vulnerable citizens in any society – a life free from violence and fear."    
Those who did not have such privilege might be tempted to envy others who did have the privilege. Those might appreciate the following warning:
"He who envies others does not obtain peace of mind."    
Those who seek such a peace of mind, might appreciate these words:    
"You find peace not by rearranging the circumstances of your life, but by realizing who you are at the deepest level."
Those who seek to realize one might at such a level, might appreciate the following mantra:
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
   

# 11. procreation   
   

One might feel gratitude for being able to find oneself reading the following words:    
"Extinction is the rule. Survival is the exception."    
The reason for the extinction might become apparent in these words:    
"When all choice is taken from you, life becomes a game of survival."    
To figure out the rules of that game of survival, one might appreciate the following realization:    
"The most important factor in survival is neither intelligence nor strength but adaptability."    
To which one might add:    
"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change."    
This insight might lead to the temptation to desire to become immortal. One might appreciate to consider biological immortality in three types:    
The first one is resistance to environment which a species called Tardigrade excell at.    
The second one is perseverence throught time, which bacterial spores excell at, which can be revived from stasis even after millions of years.    
The third one is maintenance of active metabolism, which Pinus longaeva excell at.    
Even though their remarkable ability all of those species still have the ability to procreate.    
One might appreciate the privilege being naive, to procreate regardless the prospect of the offsprings.    
But there are many species on earth which reduces their reproductive behavior if they recognize the scarecity of resources.    
But so far only humans reduce their reproduction based on abstract concepts such as their projection of the future or their sense of morality, which can be referred as "antinatalism".    
One might call it tolerance to not disturb those who have found their peace of their own mind throught applying antinatalism to their own lives.    
One might then feel the desire to counteract the act of preaching antinatalism to others.    
Since censorship would undermine freedom of speech, without which this very document would not be possible, there is a necessity for preperation of counter arguments to win a debate.    
One might appreciate the following definition for hyprocrisy as in:    
"Hyprocrisy is the audacity to preach integrity from a den of corruption."    
Those who seek to recognize such hypocricy, might appreciate these words:    
"Ostentation is the signal flag of hypocrisy."    
Those who seek to understand why hypocrisy might be ostentatious, might appreciate these words:   
"Hypocrisy can afford to be magnificent in its promises, for never intending to go beyond promise, it costs nothing."

Those who might be confronted with those, who might not be able to deliver on their promise, might appreciate these words:    
"A total absence of self-doubt is the first sign of insanity."   
Those who might then seek to become aware of their own insanity, might appreciate these words:    
"There is only one difference between a madman and myself. The madman thinks he is sane. I know I am mad."     
Those who struggle to recognize their own insanity, might appreciate these words:    
"The end point of rationality is to demonstrate the limits of rationality."    
Those who struggle to demonstrate their own limits of rationality, might appreciate these words:    
"True art is characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist."   
Those who seek to understand such art, might appreciate these words:

"Learn to love yourself first, instead of loving the idea of other people loving you."   
Those who seek to learn to love themselves, might appreciate these words:

"Good tests kill flawed theories; we remain alive to guess again."    
Those who seek to create such tests, might appreciate these words:   
"Optimism is a duty. The future is open. It is not predetermined. No one can predict it, except by chance. We all contribute to determining it by what we do. We are all equally responsible for its success."   
Those who seek to understand such responsibility, might appreciate the chapter on "responsibility". Those who struggle to embrace their responsibility, might appreciate these words:   
"For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one’s predicament into a human achievement."    
Those who seek to understand such tragedy, might appreciate these words:   
"Our own death wish is our only real tragedy."
Those who are struggling with such tragedy, might appreciate these words:   
"The tragedy is not that things are broken. The tragedy is that things are not mended again."    
Those who seek to understand why one might not want to mend what might be broken, might appreciate these words:   
"There is no such thing as freedom of choice unless there is freedom to refuse." 
[Todo: Update]

Those who then seek to survive, might appreciate the following mantra:   
"We might be all on the way to Pro."

Details might be found here: https://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model-pdf-download/ [2025.05.11]

The author of this document appreciates all current and future efforts to prevent this art project to become a "cult" for the following definition of the term "cult":   
"A cult is an organization which causes deliberate harm to at least one individual by those who can be identified as their members.

2. Manipulation of its members.   
3. Exploitation of its members or other individuals.   
4. Causing harm to its members or others.

"Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen."   
Those who seek to understand the nature of prejudice might appreciate these words:   
"Prejudice is opinion without judgement."    
Those who seek to understand the origin of one's own prejudice might appreciate these words:   
"Prejudice is a product of ignorance that hides behind barriers of tradition."   
Those who are ignorant of their own prejudice might appreciate these words:   
"Prejudice is always dangerous."   
One might understand one reason why prejudice might be of such danger in these words:   
"Prejudice is the pinnacle of self injected ignorance. It enables poor choices to be pre-chosen."    
Those who seek to understand why such choices might be "poor" in a sense of lethal, might appreciate these words:   
"The downfall of every civilization comes, not from the moral corruption of the common man, but rather from the moral complacency of common men in high places."    
One might appreciate the clarification of the phrase "men in high places" as beings who are higher ranking in the predominant social hiearchy system implying the magnitude of the influnce towards other beings, which one might refer to as "power".
Those who seek to understand such "common" beings, might appreciate the chapter on "normal". Those who seek to prevent such downfall might appreciate the chapters "integrity" and "preperation". 
Those who might find themselves struggling with such downfall might be tempted to seek a simple solution as in these words:   
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."   
Those who seek to simplify might appreciate these words:   
"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."    
One might understand one reason why not to simplify further in these words:    
"Dictators have always played on the natural human tendency to blame others and to oversimplify."    
Those who have oversimplified themselves might appreciate these words:    
"Never oversimplify yourself by using a single word or category to describe who you are. Take the time to tell your story."    
Those who seek why telling one's own story might be important might appreciate these words:    
"The world will ask you who you are, and if you don’t know, the world will tell you."    
Those who seek to know who they might be, might appreciate the following relization:

"Integrity is choosing your thoughts and actions based on values rather than personal gain."    
Those who seek to discover what such value might be, might appreciate these words:   
"The key to all of life is understanding how to add value to others."    
Those who seek to add value to others might appreciate these words:   
"Self-restraint may be alien to the human temperament, but humanity without restraint will dig its own grave."    
Those who seek to understand what to restraint, might appreciate these words:   
"Self restraint in speech, food, entertainment and vanity are the most essential fundamental of spiritual growth."   
Those who seek such growth might realize the following:   
"The simplest things that need self-restraint are the most difficult to replicate."    
Those who struggle with such difficulty might appreciate the following encouragement:   
"In times of difficulty, those brave enough to stay the course will be victors in the end."   
Those who seek to understand how to become such victor, might appreciate these words:      
"Our ability to reach unity in diversity will be the beauty and the test of our civilization."   
Those who seek to understand such unity might appreciate the chapter on "unity". One might refer to the unity in diversity as "cooperation" in the book "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind". In order to cooperate one might become aware of the obligation to civilize oneself through reading such as "etiquette". The importance of reading might become apparent in this statement:   
"The culture of a civilization is the art and literature through which it rises to consciousness of itself and defines its vision of the world."   
Those who seek to raise such consciousness of such a civilization, might appreciate these words:    
"Transparency is for those who carry out public duties and exercise public power. Privacy is for everyone else."    
One might understand one reason why transparency might be for those who carry out public duties in these words:    
"Transparency seeds collaboration."   
Those who seek to excersise such public power, might appreciate the following insight:   
"Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. The savage’s whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting one free from others."   
One may appreciate the following realization as well:   
"Privacy, precisely because it ensures that we are never fully known to others, provides a shelter for imaginative freedom, curiosity and self-reflection."    
One might then appreciate the following advice:   
"Knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving. When we can be alone, we can be with others without using them as a means of escape."   
Given the social nature of the mammalian brain it is inevitable to struggle to be alone. Those might find clues on how to enjoy solitude in these words:   
"Why love if losing hurts so much? We love to know that we are not alone."   
One may appreciate the following quote goes a step further:   
"One of the most important things you can do on this earth is to let people know they are not alone."   
One might appreciate the following mantra to remind oneself and others that one is not alone:

# 18. home   
   

iOne might find oneself on a path described in a lyrics of a song, which is as following:   
"Country roads, take me home, to the place I belong."
Those who seek a place one might belong might appreciate these words:    
"Our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self acceptance."   
Those who struggle to accept oneself might appreciate these words:   
"Acceptance of the unacceptable is the greatest source of grace in this world."   
Those who struggle to have grace with oneself, might appreciate these words:

Those who seek to do good might appreciate the chapter on "good". Those whom it makes wonder what a home might be might appreciate the following definition:   
"Home is not where you were born; home is where all your attempts to escape cease."   
Those who keep attempting to escape might appreciate these words:   
"Home isn’t a place. Home is anywhere, just as long as the people you love are there."    
Those who seek such people might appreciate the chapters "friendship" and "transcendence". Those who feels stuck somewhere, where one do not have the privilege of having people one loves, might appreciate the following realization:   
"One must learn to love oneself with a wholesome and healthy love, so that one can bear to be with oneself and need not roam."   
Those who seek to understand the necessity for the capability to bear to be with oneself, might appreciate these words:   
"I restore myself, when I am alone."
Those who struggle to restore themselves, might appreciate these words:    
"All of humanity's problems stem from one's inability to sit quietly in a room alone."    
Those who are tired of sitting in a room alone, might appreciate these words:
"When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago."   
One might appreciate this document as one way to prepare for the future attacks trying to study the mentioned "old ideas". One way to understand "old ideas" could be referred as "ideology", which definitions may vary due to its complex nature. One might then appreciate a document titled "Blood and Soil", in which the following four traits of genocidal ideologies are mentioned:   
1. "Cults of antiquity":    
The nostalgia for an idealized past awakens the deadly desire to be the "the chosen ones", which can be understood as one of the three poisons mentioned in Buddhism as "attachment". One might then find utility in the following quote:   
"You must learn from your past mistakes, but not lean on your past successes."    
2. "Fetishization of land and agriculture":    
Those "chosen ones" claim a specific piece of fertile land by force, which is only possible through the second poison mentioned in Buddism, which is "ignorance". One might appreciate the potential dangers pointed out in the following quote:    
"The first person who, having enclosed a plot of land, took it into his head to say this is mine and found people simple enough to believe him was the
true founder of civil society. What crimes, wars, murders, what miseries and horrors would the human race have been spared, had some one pulled up the stakes or filled in the ditch and cried out to his fellow men: 'Do not listen to this imposter. You are lost if you forget that the fruits of the earth belong to all and the earth to no one!'"   
3. "Ethnic hatred":   
The "chosen ones" use an common "enemy" to unite among themselves, which might remind third poison mentioned in Buddhism is "aversion", the reason for which has been recognized well as in:   
"Haters don't really hate you, they hate themselves because you're a reflection of what they wish to be."   
One might appreciate the clarity in the following description for an ideology:   
"The minimum necessary structuring ingredient of every ideology is to distance itself from another ideology, to denounce its other as ideology."   
4. "Expansion":   
The "chosen ones" desire more land than necessary for mere survial. The three poisons of buddishm are often represented as three animals biting in each others tails building a cycle, amplifying each other with each cycle, which in this case leads to expansion of the suffering. A way out has been pointed out as in:   
"If you are ruled by mind you are a king; if by body, a slave."    
Those who seek to be ruled by their mind, might appreciate another insightful possibility for definition of an ideology as following:   
"Ideology is the enemy of joyful community life, and the most destructive ideology is the belief that creating utopia is possible."   
Those who seek to understand what such a "utopia" might be, might appreciate these words:   
"Utopias rest on the fallacy that perfection is a legitimate goal of human existence."   
For those who is kept alive through the obsession of pursuing an utopia, they might appreciate the following realization:   
"Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence."   
One might then appreciate this wisdom:   
"When it is obvious that the goals cannot be reached, don't adjust the goals, adjust the action steps."    
One might appreciate the following suggestion for such an adjustment:   
"Life is a journey with problems to solve and lessons to learn but most of all: experiences to enjoy."   
It might be impossible to ultimately determine whether one is free from any ideology, but as long as one does not neglect to think for oneself, there might be hope as emphasized as in:   
"I think ideology is toxic, all ideology. It’s not that there are good ones and bad ones. All ideology is toxic, because ideology is a kind of insult to the gift of human free thinking."   
One might aprreciate the following advice on how to recognize an ideology:   
"Ideology is a partial truth masquerading as the whole truth."   
Those who claim to have attained the whole truth, might appreciate these words:    
"For someone who seems to know it all, how come you don't know that you're stupid?"    
Those who seek to understand such stupidity, might appreciate these words:
"Stupidity is the deliberate cultivation of ignorance."
Those who seek to prevent such deliberate cultivation of ignorance, might appreciate these words:
"To forget one's purpose is the commonest form of stupidity."
Those who then seek to understand how one might forget one's purpose, might appreciate these words:
"Stupidity is a talent for misconception."
Those who seek to understand such misconception might appreciate these words:
"A mark of stupidity is a belief that one party is totally virtuous and correct on the issues while the other is evil and always wrong."
Those who struggle to detach themselves from such belief, might appreciate these words:
"Stubborn and ardent clinging to one's opinion is the best proof of stupidity."
Those 
Those who seek where such stupidity might lead to, might appreciate these words:
"War means blind obedience, unthinking stupidity, brutish callousness, wanton destruction, and irresponsible murder."
Those who seek to protect themselves from such war, might appreciate these words:
"The paradoxical War on Terror is based on a kind of willed stupidity; the willed stupidity of wishful thinking. Only the logic of dreamwork can suture 'War' with 'Terror' in this way, since terrorists were, by classical definition, those without 'legitimate authority' to wage war."
Those who think that they might be such "legitimate authority", might appreciate these words:
"There is no greater tyranny than that which is perpetrated under the shield of the law and in the name of justice."
Those who seek to understand what such "legitimate authority" might be, might appreciate these words:
"The people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter, under which the several branches of government hold their power, is derived."
Those who then seek freedom from such tyranny, might appreciate these words:
"The secret of freedom lies in educating people, whereas the secret of tyranny is in keeping them ignorant."
Those who seek such education, might appreciate these words:
"We never really know what stupidity is until we have experimented on ourselves."
Those who have discovered such stupidity, might appreciate these words:
"Wisdom is the reward for surviving our own stupidity."
Those who have received such reward, might appreciate the following mantra:   
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
   

# 19. asylum   
   

Disclaimer: This is a hypothetical essay of an artist, the effort to prevent this document from being classified as terrorism will be appreciated.   
   
There is a necessity for action beyond appreciation, when one has fully grasped meaning of the following words:
"Life asks of every individual a contribution, and it is up to that individual to discover what it should be."
For one life becomes increasingly demanding so much so that one might feel the temptation to contemplate about and asylum from that demand of life.
One name for that utopia might be "artsylum",a neologism from the word art and asylum. The idea for that word was derived from the ancient greek word "asylum", which can be translated to "unrobbed". For that utopia to be actualized, at least the following five criteria need to be met, before one may refer to it as "artsylum". There is one exception to that rule, which is as follows:
"Any shelter with at least a microwave with intact power supply may qualify as a "atelier", offering food for artists while collecting resources for the actual implementation".
1. Fully renewable power source, especially nuclear fusion   
2. Full automation of fully plant based food supply   
3. Full automation of medical care   
4. Fully automated state of the art defence and stealth system   
5. Full commitment to acceptance to all refuging artists in the idea from the chapter "ultimate".
   
Currently the world is focussing on point 4, and the most simple way to survive a nuclear winter is inside a nuclear submarine, which might be inspired by the mythos of "Ark Noah".
The world needs point 3, but it will be the last to be automated, since it requires a lot of commitment to build it.
Point 2 has been already implemented to a limited degree, and it has the most potential for everyone to attempt to improve.
Point 1 has been attempted, but for short term solar panel might suffice with enough batteries.

Regarding point 5, there might be a case that there is a last person to be admitted as a refuge.
To ensure the well being of that person, there will be a need for a civilization reaching the least critical mass necessary to naturally repopulate  a planet, in case all the fail safes of the technology has failed. Considering the drastic decline in overall birthrate, a full commitment would imply an fully artificial womb for humans. No one should be forced to contribute to the genepool of humanity, but the future humanity will gratiously accept the donation. Since infant humans cannot survive without care, there would be a need for an artificial nanny robot, in case all other humans has extinguished.
This document was written to convay a mantra in the hope to prevent a dystopia as exemplified in the movie "I am mother":   
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
   

# 20. health   
   

Disclaimer: The claims made in this document is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as medical advices.
The author of this document appreciates the understanding that due to lack of resources the author is not referencing specific studies.

One might encounter such words:
"A healthy person has a hundred wishes, but a sick person has only one."
Those who seek health might appreciate the following definition:
"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."
Those who seek health beyond the limitations of health care professionals might appreciate the following enumerations of practises the author finds useful to know:
"To attain physical compleateness one might appreciate the to know, that the body can be understood as whatever processes an input and creates an output. The range and optimum might vary between individuals and therefore it might important to figure out one's own optimum. To figure out the optimum, it might be necessary to figure out the kind of variables and a methodology to measure them.
Starting with list of physiological inputs:
1. Nutrition
Nutrition is a highly controversal topic, because a part of the concept of "health" is based off of the absence of diseases.
So depending on whatever diseases one might have, whatever might be heathy might vary.
Given the the author is based off of homo sapiens sapiens, here is a list of recipes which one might be able to apply to one's own life:
1.1 Reciple for the  "ultimate buddha bowl":
This dish was designed to minimize the necessity for diversity of plants to grow, but yet to be nutrionally complete and to avoid commonly prevelant causes of death at the point of writing:
To privent cardio vascular diseases, one might appreciate the advice not use oil or fats during the cooking process.
Even though roasting or commonly referred as "maillard reaction" has been scientifically proven to be harmful for the human body.
The usage of teflon coated non stick pans is also not advisable.
Heating food in plastic containers is known to be harmful as well.
It might be necessary for some ingredients to apply heat to increase the absorption rate of nutrients, breakdown harmful compounds or to eliminate harmful microbes.
Therefore the author advices to use foodsafe silicone container commonly known as "Stasher". (Disclaimer: The author is neither sponsored nor associated with that company in any way. The advice is purely subjective opinion of the author.)
One utility of that container is that it can serve as a dish to eat out from and can be portable given its tight sealing.
User might be advised not to carelessly transport fluids.
The original use case of that silicone container was to offer a product which can be repeatedly used during a cooking method called "sous vide".
But for this recipe, it will be used to cook rice, lentis and optionally quinoa with carrots and shiitake mushrooms with water
inside a electrically pressure cooker.
There has been studies stating the utility of shiitake mushrooms to fight cancer.
There are also some utility in button mushrooms and for the lion's mane mushrooms there has been observation to be neuroregenerative.
Root vegetables such as carrots might benefit with vitamis to avoid night blindness and the carotinoids might offer a skin tone in the facial area to appear healthy to other humans.
The usage of rice is based in the human nature of being a starchivore, and the substitution of lentils and quinoa is to reduce the consumed amount of calories and increase the protein content of this meal.
The shelf life of rice, lentils and quinoa are quite stable reducing the cost for management.
One might appreciate the advice to invest in a smart electric pressure cooker, so one might be able to seperate cooking from eating, to be 'faster than fastfood'.
To prevent diabetes one might appreciate the advice not use sugar. One reason is it causes a crash in blood sugar levels and might leading to overeating. Another reason is insulin resistance if consumed exessively for a prolonged period. Another reason is acts as a toxin for mitochondria cells and decreases the metabolic rate which might be one of the reasons for metabolic syndrome. Eventhough the human body has the ability to absorb quite an amount of blood sugar, the excess might deposit on joints causing further damage.
Another way to prevent diabetes is to calculate ones own value of non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), to determine the amount of maintencance daily calory intake.
In that same type of silicone container it is possible to marinate tofu and other prepared vegetables such as egg plants and marinate it. Tofu derived from soy beans has all the essential amino acids in a optimal distribution for humans. Ingestion of animal proteins are not adives baucause it is carcinogenic. Generally it is recommendable to minimize salt intake to avoid high blood pressue and other diseases. But one might still appreciate the idea to use with one part soy sauce and one part vinear to make it tasty. Vinegar has shown some correlation to stabilize blood sugar levels during ingestion of carbohydrates. One might appreciate the idea to optionally add chilli, since there has been found a correlation that chillis might reduce appetite if overeating is one issue.
The marinade can be used as sauce on the rice mixture as well.
To avoid cancer one might appreciate the advice to add cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli sprouts as garnish.
One might apreciate the advice to add mustard to the mix, because it has the ablity to regenerate sulforaphane when it was broken down though heat or oxidation.
To reduce the risk of depression it might appreciate the advice to abstain from alcohol consumption, because it can have depressive effect and it is an neurotoxins.
Another advice would be to add fermented food such as kimchi.
To make kimchi apply salt to nappa cabbage, and let it dehydrate for few hous and drain the excess water and salt. It might be tasty to add daikon raddish and carrots.
Then heat rice flour with a kelp and mushroom extract to make a slurry. To increase taste garlic paste and nashi or apple paste might be beneficial. If that mixture has thickend, let it cool off to room temperature and add it to the cabbage and mix well.
Optinally spring onions, chilli flakes commonly referred as 'gochugaru' and grated ginger might be beneficial.
Ginger has the property to decease pain and boost immune functions.
Put the kimchi into a container and submerge it into the excess moisture coming out of the cabbage to enable anaerobic fermentation process of the lactobacteria present on the cabbage for few days and keep in the fridge.
If there is a white layer, it might be the lactobacteria, but if it is colourful or hairy it might be mold.
If it is mold it is advised not to consume them because of the mycotoxins.
Another way to decrease the risk for depression is is through the addition of 20g of ground walnuts for DHA, which are precursor for omega3-fatty acids which is crutial for the maintainance of cognitive ability.
Those who do not have the time to eat such meals, might find utility in ingesting soy protein isolates, with creatine and phsyllium husk. Creatine seems to aid activity of mitochondria which is not only beneficial for athletic perfomances but can also slow down the rate of decrease of cognitive abilities. Psyllium husk is filling and its water soluable fiber content is beneficial for the microbiota aiding digestion.
Some might have allergic reactions or intolerances to some compounds in the ingredients. An proceeding check for tolerance might be advisable.

1.2 Exposure to toxins
To avoid organ failure one might appreciate the advice not to neglect research of ingreadients containing toxins and heavy metals.
Naturally grown mushrooms are proned to absorb heavy metals, which might even be radioactive.
Naturally grown rice might contain arsenic since it tends to absorb and accumulate it.
The usage of pesticides, insecticides, fungicides and herbicides might have negative influence for infant humans or during pregnancy.
Depending on the methods of storage, there might be mold or other sources of diseases which can also be toxic.
Genetic engineering of crops might not be inherently harmful but most common reason is to increase resistance to pesticides etc.
There might be trends of "detoxification diets", but usually detoxificaiton happens in the liver and kidneys.
For some plants might be beneficial to discart the water it was cooked in to avoid ingestion of watersoluable toxins.
Here is a recipe for the "ultimate salad":

1.3 Exposture to environmental factors
Regular exposure to sunlight is recommended for recalibrating the circadadian rhythm, secretion of serotonin and vitamin synthesis.
To maintain one's circadian rhythm it is recommended to eat at regular hours. There are several reasons for that. One reason is to prevent impulsive overeating because one mechanism of hunger that grelin the hormone making one hungy is secreted at a certain time. Another reason is to increase sleep quality. it is generally recommended not to eat three hours before bedtime. Another reason is the limitation of absorbtion rate, especially protein. The average human body can process about 30g per protein every 3-4 hours. So an eavenly spaced ingestion of protein might be beneficial to maintain athletic abilities.
Here is a recipe for the "ultimate ice cream":

2. Mental wellbeing
Those who seek mental wellbeing might appreciate the chapters on hope, meaning, connection and love.

3. Social wellbeing
Those who seek social wellbeing might appreciate the chapter on love, friendship, civilization, harmony, maturity and malevolence.

Output:
4. Physical wellbeing
Humans have two types of nervous systems. The autonomic nervous system and somatic nervous system. One central part of the autonomic nervious system is the circadian rhythm and once that rhythm is malfunctioning, it might because of of the many causes for depression. Aside from already mentioned exposure to regular sunlight, sleep and food intake, regular stimulation and movement patterns to stimulate the autonomic nervous system might be beneficial. It can be achieved through the usage of the somatic nervious system, the part which a human can consciously control. Activities such as conscious breathing, walking and chewing has been proven to be beneficial. Apart from those activities, one might seek to prepare for an emergency in one's own life. Those might to strengthen one's own body through regular excersise. There are three kinds to such excersises. First one is commonly referred as "sport", which is the aquisition of specific athletic ability to achieve a specific purpose such as having fun, such as "soccer". It might increase the risk for injury due to factors outside of one's locus of control and thus generally not advisable, but it might be beneficial to find kins. Second are balancing excersises such as climing, balancing on a rope. It might still pose some risk for injury but the risk can be minimized if done with caution and precaution. The third type is workout. There are many ways and tradition for workout. To maximize muscle mass or so called "hypertrophy" a method called progressive overload might be benefitial. But it has quite high risk for injury due to subjective overestimation of one's own capability of the body commonly referred as "ego lifiting", which is generally not recommendable. The second type is endurance training. It has also some elevated risk for injury but it can increase mood through the secretion of endorphines commonly referred as "runner's high". The third type is funcitonal training. It focuses on whole body movements to maintain athletic abilities useful for everyday with the minimal risk for injuries. There are many ways to excersize functional training. Here are few types the author has tried out:
4.1 Calisthenics
One 
4.2 Rings
4.3 Kettlebell
4.4 HIIT 
5. Digestion
   

# 21. responsibility   
   

One might suffer from the feeling of being "lost" as in:
"I am free and that is why I am lost."
Those who are lost might appreciate these words:
"The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others."
One might appreciate the following words to understand why that might be:
"The root of happiness is altruism – the wish to be of service to others."
Those who wonder why one might wish to be in service might appreciate these words:
"Love is the wish to give, not to receive."
Those who seek to understand love might appreciate the chapter on "transcendene".
Those who were not fortunate to experience such love might raise such question as:
"Altruism has always been one of biology's deep mysteries. Why should any animal, off on its own, specified and labeled by all sorts of signals as its individual self, choose to give up its life in aid of someone else?"
Those who are still wondering might appreciate the following realization:
"Animals have genes for altruism, and those genes have been selected in the evolution of many creatures because of the advantage they confer for the continuing survival of the species."
Those who do not understand the advantage yet might appreciate these words:
"When you cease to make a contribution, you begin to die."
Those who seek to contribute might appreciate these words:
"The best contribution one can make to humanity is to improve oneself."
Those who improve themselves might appreciate these words:
"The essence of independence is to be able to do something for one's self."
Those who seek independence might appreciate these words:
"True independence and freedom can only exist in doing what's right."
Those who seek to do what is right might appreciate the following advice:
"Doing the right thing is not the problem. Knowing what the right thing is, that's the challenge."
Those who seek such knowledge might appreciate these words:
"Wisdom is not gained by knowing what is right. Wisdom is gained by practicing what is right, and noticing what happens when that practice succeeds and when it fails."
Those who seek to practice what might be right might appreciate the following warning:
"Failing to prepare is preparing to fail."
Those who seek to prepare might appreciate these words:
"Whatever your weakness, there's a hellion to exploit it."
Those who seek to know such weakness might appreciate these words:
"Sacrifice is the ecstasy of giving the best we have to the One we love most."
The reason why such ecstasy might be a weakness might be able to be understood in the following warning:
"Ecstasy cannot be constant, or it would kill."
Those who cannot decide who one loves most might appreciate these words:
"If you have the ability to love, love yourself first."
Those who seek to love oneself might appreciate these words:
"Abundance is knowing that everything you need has already been supplied."
Those who seek to understand what one needs, might appreciate the chapter on "needs".
Those who seek to understand abundance might appreciate these words:
"Abundance doesn't follow giving until giving becomes its own reward."
Those who seek to understand why other motivation to give might be detrimental might appreciate these words:
"Benevolence does not consist in those who are prosperous pitying and helping those who are not. It consists in fellow feeling that puts you upon actually the same level with the fellow who suffers."
One might understand one reason why that is through these words:
"The best help that benevolence and philanthropy can give is that which induces everybody to help himself."
Those who seek to induce others so help themselves might appreciate these words:
"Ask for help. Not because you are weak. But because you want to remain strong."
Those who have been asked for help might appreciate these words:
"We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone."
Those who seek to find someone one might be able to help, might appreciate the advice to seek professionals who are qualified to help. Some might become resentful, because they were not fortunate to find such help for any given reason. Those might appreciate these words:
"Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom."
Those who seek such groth and freedom might the following statement:
"Freedom is nothing but a chance to be better."
Those who seek courage to take that chance to be better might appreciate these words:
"Everything can be taken from a person but one thing: the last of the human freedoms –  to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."
While searching for one's own way, one might come to the same conclusion as in:
"Virture offers the only path in this life that leads to tranquility."
Those who seek tranquility might appreciate the chapters "peace", "good", "friendship", "maturity", "integrity", "harmony", "honor" and "malevolence".
Those who have already reached tranquility might appreciate the following warning:
"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same."
One might be inspired to become the solution due to the following quote:
"Freedom means that one is responsible for one’s own choices, actions, one’s own life situation."
One might appreciate the simplicity of the following understanding of responsiblity:
"Responsibility is the ability to respond."
One may appreciate the following quote as a basic guideline on how to respond:
"Before you speak, ask yourself,
is it kind, is it necessary, is it true,
does it improve the silence?"
One might find inspiration how to actually
improve the silence in these words:
"We must never allow the voice of humanity within us to be silenced.

# 26. hero   
   

Disclaimer: This document does not intended to endorse any political movement in particular. It is just a general philosophical essay.

Those who seek joy might encounter such words:
"The key of joy is disobedience."
One reason for it might be found in these words:
"Disobedience is the stamp of the hero."
One might find one reason why disobedience so valuable might find a clue to understand it in these words:
"Self-esteem comes from being able to define the world in your own terms and refusing to abide by the judgments of others."
Those who seek to understand the origin of the concept of hero might appreciate the following realization which the author assumes was made by an individual which might be referred as an "adult":
"You see, children aspire to be the hero they see in us everyday – the one who responds to their needs – the responsible, reliable, 'go to.'"
Those who did not have the privilege to encounter such an individual worthy to asprire to might appreciate the following realization:
"You are the hero of your own story."

"Authority and power are two different things: power is the force by means of which you can oblige others to obey you. Authority is the right to direct and command, to be listened to or obeyed by others. Authority requests power. Power without authority is tyranny."
One might appreciate the reason why one might want to avoid tyrany:
"Anarchy is the sure consequence of tyranny; for no power that is not limited by laws can ever be protected by them."
Some may feel resistance towards the idea of anarchy. They might appreciate the following definition:
"Anarchism is not some automatic guarantee that no one will ever be violated. It is the rejection of automatic, guaranteed violation of all people."
Those so seek such such automatic guarantee might appreciate the following realization:
"It is impossible to design a system so perfect that no one needs to be good."
Those who are not naive to blindly belief in authority might appreciate the following definition of "authority":
"Authority is not power; that's coercion. Authority is not knowledge; that's persuasion, or seduction. Authority is simply that the author has the right to make a statement and to be heard."

"Freedom means you are unobstructed in living your life as you choose. Anything less is a form of slavery."
Those who are confused about the difference of the terms "liberty" and "freedom" might appreciate the clarity of this definition:
"Liberty depends on self-restraint. Freedom is freedom only when controlled and limited."
Those who do not want to self-restraint might appreciate the following warning:
"The price of freedom may be high, but never so costly as the loss of freedom."

"Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school."
Those who seek to understand what might remain of such an education, might appreciate these words:
"It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."
Those who might resent schools might appreciate the following piece of wisdom:
"Wisdom is not a product of schooling but the lifelong attempt to acquire it."
Those who seek wisdom might appreciate the following realization:
"Education best serves students by helping them be more self-reflective."

Those who might loose their confidence in themselves might appreciate the following realization:
"True humility is not the absence of confidence but strength restrained."

"Ethics is a code of values which guide our choices and actions and determine the purpose and course of our lives."
One might appreciate the guidante to repeatedly recite the following mantra to adhere to the vows one has already taken or yet to take:
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
   

# 27. contentment   
   

Those who seek satisfaction might encounter such statement:
"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied;"
Regardless whether pigs could actually be satisfied, those who are still dissatisfied might appreciate the following realization:
"At some point, you gotta let go, and sit still, and allow contentment to come to you."
Those who seek to understand contentment might apprecite these words:
"Contentment is natural wealth; luxury is artificial poverty."
One might be able to appreciate such natural wealth with the following realization:
"The secret of contentment is the realization that life is a gift, not a right."
Those who do not know what to do with the gift called life might appreciate the following advice:
"Appreciate what you have while you still have it because one day you won’t."
Those who do not know how to appreciate life might appreciate the following advice:
"Appreciation can make a day, even change a life. Your willingness to put it into words is all that is necessary."
Those who struggle to put the appreciation for one's own life into words might appreciate the following mantra:
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
   

# 28. soul   
   

Someone once said:
"Understand me. I'm not like an ordinary world. I have my madness, I live in another dimension and 
I do not have time for things that have no soul."
One thus may ponder what that entity called "soul" may be.
It is so far immeasurable with the state of the art scientific equipment.
Since science is based in falsification, it is impossible to prove the existence of a soul. So the only scientific method which is applicable to soul is to falsify its existence.
Such attempt might be furtile because it might have failed because of insufficient means.
One might appreciate those who keep devoting their efforts trying to falsify the existence of a soul with scientific methods inspire of its furtile nature without harming any living beings.
Those who seeks to contribute to such scienece might appreciate the scientific discovery that mindful activities such as meditation might increase one's own cognitive ability which might be useful to contribute to science.
Other activities known to increase cognitive abilities are activities which requires balance,
such as bouldering, surfing or slacklining.
Those who do not have the privilege to pursue such science nor the desire to contribute might find blissful distraction in fictional scriptures which might prevent causing harm to living beings.
Those who seek such fictional scriptures might appreciate the rest of this chapter:
One might realize to appreciate one's own freedom to describe "soul" as in:
"Your core values are the deeply held beliefs that authentically describe your soul."
One might appreciate the following advice to find an authentic description of one's own soul: 
"Soul is about finding the things in your life that are real and pure."
Those who has not found what they may claim as "pure" might appreciate the following words:
"Beauty is the purest feeling of the soul. Beauty arises when soul is satisfied."
Those who wonder what may satisfy one's soul might appreciate the following realization:
"The purest form of listening is to listen without memory or desire."
One might find appreciation fo the clarity in these words:
"The difference between hearing and listening is paying attention."
One may then appreciate the following words:
"Paying attention is the most basic and profound expression of love."
Those who seek such expression of love might appreciate the following words:
"To say that one waits a lifetime for his soulmate to come around is a paradox. People eventually get sick of waiting, take a chance on someone, and by the art of commitment become soulmates, which takes a lifetime to perfect."
Those who seek to become a soulmate for someone might appreciate these words:
"People think a soulmate is your perfect fit, and that’s what everyone wants. But a true soulmate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life."
Those who seek to recognize such being might appreciate these words:
"A soulmate is someone whom, when you meet, without thinking, without letting your neocortex play into the decision; you feel an instant familiarity, a sense of connection, a longing."
Those who seek to find out whether that connection is mutual might appreciate these words:
"We recognize a soulmate by the supreme level of comfort and security we feel with that person. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t issues that remain to be ironed out. Rather, it means we know intuitively that we can resolve issues with our soul mate without losing his or her love and respect."
One might then appreciate the clarity of the following definition:
"A soul mate is someone whose way of viewing life is not necessarily the same as yours but complements yours. There is not a compromise, there is a complement."
Those who seek encounter someone might complement oneself, might appreciate these words:
"We meet our soulmates when we’re on our soul path.
One might find such a path by saying the following mantra:
"We might be all on the way to Pro."

   

# 29. meaning   
   

So far humans are the only creatures which has been observed to seek for the answer for their meaning of their own existence.
One should be very vigilant to anyone claiming to have a definitive answer, because it might be a cult trying to exploit.
So there is a necessity to reach a conclusion on ones own, but not everyone can have the necessary resources to do so.
One may appreciate the following personal take on the topic.

One of the "four noble truth" according to the buddhists is one essence of life is suffering, which they call "dukkha".
Faced with that truth, one has the choice of one of three options to cope with this suffering:
The first option is the easiest but destructive, which is to numb this suffering with pleasure, which is called hedonism.
The second option, often practiced by buddhists is to detach themselves from their desire and 
thus suffering through harsh training and meditation. But they oversee the fundamental nature that
no human can survive alone.
At some point in the life of a human, that human had contact with other humans, who helped them survive.
Since the mammalian brain is wired for empathy,
the only way to find peace is to give up the idea of helping all the other humans and become reclusive in a monastery.
The third option is to forget the suffering while being in the state of "flow".
One may refer to the "flow-state" as a "joyful" and "excited" state,
when fully immersed in a action.
One can refer to the meditative state of the buddhists also as flow,
but the approach is different. To reach the state of flow through action,
one needs to find and work on a skill, which is in essence "self actualization" proposed by the "hierarch of needs".
The author of that book proposed that humans have also non-materialistic needs,
and humans would suffer, if those needs are not met.
But to reach that level, all the other levels of the hierarchy of needs must be met first, otherwise one will be overwhelmed. 
Regarding the action to bear the suffering one can understand the reference to a document "Man's search for meaning"
to which it has been referred as: "The purpose of life is finding the largest burden that you can bear and bearing it." (One might appreciate the understanding that "man" in this context is a generalization of human, which is regardless the gender.)
If one succeeds in getting intoo the flow state while one is in the act of bearing the suffering, one can transcend his own suffering.
In the "hierarchy of needs" it is called "self transcendence",
which is to offer all the abundant resources and skills accumulated during the process of "self actualization".
If one dares to have a look at this world with open eyes and heart,
one might be overwhelmed by "Weltschmerz", which is german word for the lack of adecuate means to eliviate the suffering of the world.
To reduce this suffering,
humanity needs to help each other but currently it lacks the necessary means to efficiently and effectively unite and coordinate those resources and skills.

The "Voice of Humanity" project aims to connect those in need and those who can help through the same named foundation,
which may enable the access through an AI assisted online voice recorder in the future.
There people may receive the necessary help to self actualize and then offer that skill and resourced to the people in need,
so there won't be the need for detachment and closing ones eyes to the suffering of this world.
It is indeed a utopic idea, but so far it is the only idea known to humanity,
which could lead to longterm reduction of human suffering and the maximazation of joy of life.
   

# 30. mission   
   

Disclaimer: This document includs topis on mental health.

A life in a state of low awareness will be effortless,
because it is mere priviledge which miraculously kept one alive.
A life in a state of high awareness will be effortful,
which would stretch the perception of one second to infinity.
If one would see another suffering in that state of high awareness caused by chronic pain, one might be tempted to "euthanasia", which is to murder such person and refer to it as "mercy".
Such support of such death wish is commonly referred as suicide, which is not an option which can be reverted.
Thus one might be tormented knowing that others might continue a life live in suffering.
That torment might be commonly referred in german as "Weltschmerz" which can be translated to "world pain".
One might find a reason why humanity is still alive is, because humans are the only known species to be able to see meaning in that "Weltschmerz" as in:
"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how."
Those who were not fortunate to find a "why", might appreciate help of a health care professional to find a way to their "why", as postulated as:
"Assisted suicide is a reversal of the proper role of a doctor as a healer, comforter and consoler to an improper role of the physician causing a patient's death."
Those who were fortunate to find a "why" or such a help might appreciate to attribute such effort as "art".
One might then appreciate to refer to the effort to unite humanity despite of the suffering of individuals, which will be one of the most effortful event in the history of humankind, requiring everything what each life of individuals has to offer as "the ultimate art" which is further explained in the chapter "ultimate".
Those who are still suffering might appreciate the following encouraging words for guidance:
"Until your mission is an obsession, nothing will change in your life."
Those who have yet to find their mission might appreciate the following realization:
"My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style."
Those who seek to thrive might appreciate the chapters "hope", "peace", "good" and "responsiblity".
Those who struggle to thrive might appreciate these words:
"The magic you are looking for is in the work you are avoiding."
Those who seek to overcome such avoidance of work might get started by saying the following mantra:
"We might be all on the way to Pro"
   

# 31. transcendence   
   

One might find oneself having a bad day as in:   
"All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest one alive to lunacy."   
Those who struggle with such a bad day might appreciate these words:   
"Turn really bad days into really good data."   
Those who seek to understand what such data might be, might appreciate these words:   
"Information is just bits of data. Knowledge is putting them together. Wisdom is transcending them."   
After that quote one might appreciate the following insight on the value of putting information together:   
"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."   
One might appreciate the following warning while searching for such wisdom:   
"Be aware of unearned wisdom."   
One aspect of the reason to why that author might have wanted to warn, might revieal in the follwing quote:   
"The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom."    
As one once said:   
"Knowledge becomes wisdom only after it has been put to good use."   
One might appreciate the following piece of wisdom:   
"Avoid people who say they know the answer. Keep the company of people who are trying to understand the question."    
The first schools originating in ancient Greece inspired to pursue ones curiosity, but through standartization of tests modern schools became more of a sieve for obedience.   
As one once said:   
"Art has the role in education of helping children become like themselves instead of more like everyone else."    
One might have already understood the problem:    
"All children are artists. The problem is how to remain an artist one he grows up."   
One might see a solution approach to that problem as in:   
"The ultimate question for a responsible one to ask is not how he is to extricate himself heroically from the affair, but how the coming generation is going to live."   
Those who are concerned with the upbringing of such a generation, might appreciate the following thought:
"Religion attacks us in our deepest integrity by saying we wouldn't be a able to make a moral decision without it."    
Those who seek to make moral decisions without compromising the integrity of their own mind, might appreciate these words:    
"Religion is for people who’re afraid of going to hell. Spirituality is for those who’ve already been there."    
Those who seek to understand, what such might result in, might appreciate these words:
"When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called a religion."
Those who seek to understand what such hell might refer to, might appreciate these words:   
"Hell is not fire and brimstone, not a place where you are punished for lying or cheating or stealing. Hell is wanting to be something and somewhere different from where you are."     
Those who are struggling in such hell, might appreciate these words:    
"You can make hell out of heaven and heaven out of hell. It’s all in the mind."    
Those who seek to make heaven out of hell, might appreciate these words: 
"Spirituality is an awareness of the sacred beyond what we can see."     
Those who seek to understand which one might refer to as sacred, might appreciate these words:   
"Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind." 
Those who seek to restore their integrity of their own mind, might appreciate these words:    
"Enlightenment is one's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity."   
Those who seek such emergence, might appreciate these words:   
"Maturity is having the courage to use one's own intelligence."   
As someone already pointed out:   
"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change."   
The biggest change one can refuse is to knowledge as stated in:   
"True ignorance is not the absence of knowledge, but the refusal to acquire it."   
Those who seek to aquire knowledge might appreciate the following words:   
"Transcendence means going beyond duality. Attachment means remaining within duality."   
One might see a clue for transcendence in the following realization:   
"Only in love are unity and duality not in conflict."   
The word "love" can be understood in many different ways. Those who are overwhelmed by the diversity of meaning might appreciate this realization:   
"To define is to limit."   
Those who seek to overcome one's own limitation might appreciate these words:   
"Love is the most powerful force in the world, transcending all limits and boundaries."   
As long as everyone remains the freedom of defining it for oneself it would not end in censorship.   [UPDATE]
Those who still seek a definition to agree to with consent might appreciate the following definition:   
"Love is the wish to give, not to receive, something."   
Those who do not know what to give might appreciate these words:   
"The most desired gift of love is not diamonds or chocolate. It is focused attention."   
One might appreciate the advice on how to implement love:   
"The first duty of love is to listen."   
Once one is able to fulfill that first duty of love, one might be able to find all the "four elements of true love" mentioned in the concept called "Zen":
1. "Meinhu": Brotherhood love (discover the need of others = understanding)   
2. "Karuna": Compassionate love (try helping their suffering)   
3. "Mudita": Joyful love (enjoy together, effort to offer joy in times of need)   
Those who seek to understand such joyful love, might appreciate these words:    
"We may admire people for being wise, but we like them best when they are foolish."    
4. "Upeksha": Non discriminatory love (Inclusive and calm love)   
After one has gained the ability to recognize the elements of true love, one might appreciate the warning not to love blindly:   
"Love is giving someone the power to completely destroy you, and hoping that they won’t."   
Once one has recognized destructive tendencies, one might find strength in these words to save oneself:
"You never stop loving someone. You just learn to live without them."    
One might appreciate the compassion in these words in such a situation:   
"The most painful state of being is remembering the future, particularly the one you'll never have."   
Those who are in that painful state might appreciate these words:   
"In every moment you have the choice to be a victim or a creator."   
One might appreciate the encouragement, who chose to be a creator:   
"There is nothing more truly artistic than to love people."   
One might appreciate the following understanding of art:   
"Art is to console those who are broken by life."   
One might appreciate another understanding of art:   
"Art is a form of love. Art is the ultimate gift. Art heals life."   
Those who seek to heal oneself might appreciate the following realization:   
"Healing yourself is connected with healing others."   
In order to heal others and oneself one might appreciate the theory for an healthy relationship:   
1. Passion   
One might appreciate the following warning regarding passion:   
"Passion makes idiots of the cleverest men, and makes the biggest idiots clever."   
2. Intimacy   
Those who seek such intimacy, might appreciate these words:   
"Intimacy is being seen and known as the person you truely are."    
Those who struggle to create such intimacy, might appreciate these words:    
"Distance isn't the amount of miles between us, it's the amount of things we don't say to each other."    
Those who 
3. Commitment   
Those who seek such commitment, might appreciate the chapter on integrity.   
There is another modern approach, which is similar yet different, describing four stages of a relationship:   
1. Admiration (Unrequited love)   
Those who seek to understand why one might feel such admiration, might appreciate these words:   
"It is the rooted instinct in men to admire what is better and more beautiful than themselves."   
Those who struggle to feel such admiration, might appreciate these words:    
"Transform jealousy to admiration, and what you admire will become part of your life."    
Those who seek a way to such transform, might appreciate the following realization:    
"The very essence of romance is uncertainty."     
Those who struggle with such uncertainty, might appreciate these words:   
"If uncertainty is unacceptable to you, it turns into fear. If it is perfectly acceptable, it turns into increased aliveness, alertness, and creativity."   
Those who then seek certainty, might appreciate these words:    
"To be uncertain is to be uncomfortable, but to be certain is to be ridiculous."   
Those who then seek to accept such uncertainty, might appreciate these words:   
"The quality of wit inspires more admiration than confidence."     
2. Mutual attraction (Not only limited to Eros, but also other qualties such as their intellect, humor, etc.)   
Those who seek such mutual attraction, might appreciate the following warning:   
"It is impossible to love someone you do not respect, but there can be mutual attraction without mutual respect."   
3. Commitment (label of exclusive relationship, marriage, having or raising children)   
Those who seek to understand why such a commitment might be integral, might appreciate these words:    
"Commitment is what transforms a promise into reality."    
4. Compatibility (The unnegotiable things are not a burden to each other.)   
Those who seek such compatibility, might appreciate these words:    
"Compatibility doesn't determine the fate of a marriage, how you deal with the incompatibilities, does."    
One might then realize that there are other forms of love, as described by ancient philosophers distinguishing six forms of love.     
The 3 well known distictions of love:   
1. Eros = Romantic love   
2. Philia = Friendly love   
3. Agape = Unconditional love   
But there are also lesser known forms of love:   
4. Philautia = Self love   
5. Xenia = Guest love   
6. Storge = Familial love   
One might feel overwhelmed by all the theory about love and might be longing for simplicity as in:   
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."   
Those might appreciate the simplicity in these words:   
"Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage."   
One might appreciate the understanding of courage:   
"Courage is not the absence of fear. It is the decision to move forward in spite of that fear."   
Someone already realized that this courage is necessary as expressed in the following quote:   
"A strong relationship requires choosing to love each other even in those moments when you struggle to like each other."
Someone realized that such choice might often not be voluntary:   
"Infantile love follows the principle: 'I love because I am loved.'    
Mature love follows the principe 'I am loved because I love'   
Immature love says: 'I love you because I need you.'    
Mature love says: I need you because I love you."    
One might appreciate the following categorization into four types of attachment styles observed in infants which has been developed further over the years. There are more fine grained distinction, but one might appreciate this more simplified version:
1. secure attachment: Stays stable even during tough times.
2. anxious attachment: During tough times seeking more validation.
3. avoidant attachment: During tough times seeking more alone time.
4. anxious and avoidant attachment: Behaves avoidant, but internally seeking for connection.
To those who secretly seek for connection and are in need for clarity regarding whether someone loves oneself, but is indecisive whether the other is ready for a confrontation, the following words might be helpful:    
"Truth without love is brutality, and love without truth is hypocrisy."   
If one is hurting oneself through unrequited love through exploitation, it would be advisable to confront for self love. If one thinks one has recognized all the elements of true love for the other, one need to understand, that one lacks the understanding, whether the confrontation is helping the other as stated in:   
"The highest form of love is consideration."   
One might then appreciate the considerate advice:   
"Generosity is not only about money. There is more than one currency. Let your generosity be pervasive in life."   
Those who wonder what currency to give might find inspiration in these words:   
"Attention is the most important currency that anybody can give you. It’s worth more than money, possession, or things."   
Those who seek to understand why one's attention might have such worth, might appreciate these words:
"Simply paying attention allows us to build an emotional connection."
Those who seek to build such emotional connection, might appreciate the following warning:   
"If you don’t pay appropriate attention to what has your attention, it will take more of your attention than it deserves."   
Those who are not aware what has their attention might appreciate the following advice:   
"The love and attention you always thought you wanted from someone else is the love and attention you first need to give to yourself."    
Those who feel a sensation of abundance after one has focused on oneself might appreciate these words:   
"Self-actualization cannot be attained, if it is made an end in itself, but only as a side effect of self-transcendence."   
Those who seek to transcend oneself might appreciate the following realization:    
"People who seek attention, need all the help they can get."   
One might find and offer help by saying:   
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
   

# 32. preperation   
   

Disclaimer: This document includes topic about mental health and death.

Those who feel overwhelmed by life might appreciate the following words:
"Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards."
Those who seek to understand might appreciate the following statement:
"Creativity is the ability to introduce order into the randomness of nature."
Those who seek to understand order might appreciate these words:
"I think order depends more on preparation than control."
Those who seek to understand why that is might appricate the following three steps:
Firstly, to understand why order depends less on control one might appreciate these words:
"The more we value things outside our control, the less control we have."
Those who seek to know what it is which seeks control might appreciate the following realization:
"Control is an imaginary boundary the ego thinks it's in charge of."
Those who seek to understand the ego might appreciate the following following words:
"The ego doesn't know that the source of all energy is within you, so it seeks it outside."
Those who seek control within oneself might appreciate the following explaination:
"Ego means self-identification with thinking, to be trapped in thought, which means to have a mental image of 'me' based on thought and emotions. So ego is there in the absence of a witnessing presence."
One might find utility of ego in a state of short term survival as in:
"The ego's job is to kill everything but itself."
Thus any attempt to witness and testification of one's own ego might trigger the defence mechanis of the ego as in:
"If your ego is hurt you may become angry. Understand that ego itself is a disease. Dissolve your ego as far as possible. If you have inferiority complex, or have a very deficient ego you will loose your temper very easily."
Those who seek to dissolve their ego, might appreciate these words:
"Quick success builds ego, slow success builds character."
Those who seek to build such character, might appreciate the chapters "character" and "patience".
Those who seek to understand, why such defence mechanism is triggered, might appreciate these words:
"Safety is the most basic task of all. Without the sense of safety, no growth can take place. Without safety, all energy goes to defence."
Thus those who seek long term surival might appreciate the following proverb:
"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."
Those who seek to go far might appreciate the following realization:
"Strategy is choice. Strategy means saying no to certain kinds of things."
Thus one might regain control for long term surival by saying "no" to the react impulsively to defend one's own ego.
Those who struggle to resist that impulse might appreciate the chapter on "responsibility".
One might then be able to understand the following statement:
"Confidence is essential, but ego is not."
Secondly, to understand the importance of preperation one might appreciate these words:
"Confidence comes from being prepared."
Those who seek to understand why that might be, might appreciate these words:
"He who is best prepared can best serve his moment of inspiration."
Those who seek such moment, might appreciate the explaination on stategy:
"Tactics is knowing what to do, when there is something to do. Strategy is knowing what to do when there is nothing to do."
Those who do not know what to do when there is nothing to do might appreciate these words:
"Strategy is not the consequence of planning, but the opposite: its starting point."
Those who do not know how to start planning might appreciate these words:
"Planning is bringing the future into the present."
Those who get too attached to a plan might appreciate the following warning:
"Plans are useless, but planning is essential."
One might find a reason for why plans are useless in these words:
"No amount of guilt can change the past and no amount of worrying can change the future."
Those who seek to change the future might appreciate these words:
"Realize deeply that the present moment is all you will ever have."
Those who seek to use one's own present moment to prepare might appreciate the following limited enumeration for a possible cause of one's cause death:
- Black out / power outage:
	- Renewable or sustainable power sources
	- Fortification of existing power grid
	- Efforts to sustain offgrid life style
	- Solar Flares:
		- Make electronics EMP proof
		- Have spare parts inside a EMP proof casing
		- Improving means of prediction through observation of cycles
- Climate change and weather extremes:
	- Less reckless consumer behaviour
	- More investment in sustainable innovations
	- More research in safe places to live
	- Fully autarkic hydroponic agricultural systems
	- Working on an instance of artsylum
- War and cyberwarfare:
	- Education of wisdom enabling those who seek war to agree on the necessity of world peace.
	- Better means for resource distribution
	- Better process or improvement of operation of governments
	- Education about cyber security, artificial intelligence and technology.
	- Creation of automated defense mechanism
- Declining birthrate:
	- Education about factors for infertility
	- Increasing financial support and incentive for caregivers (e.g. UBI (universal basic income),
	- Education, therapy and volunterring for caregivers.
	- Preservation of genetic diversity through donation of cells for procreation.
	- Plan B: Artificial womb or cloning.
- Pandemic:
	- Education and research.
	- Maintaing and increasing means to produce means for medical care
	- Financial support to distribute such products to those in need.
- Asteroid:
	- Longterm observation of celestial bodies
	- Innovation in space travel to counter act them or to escape it.
- Suicide:
	- Seek the help of a health care professional.
	- Find something to live for such as meaning in one's own suffering.
	- Talk to someone who listens compassionately.
Thirdly those who seek to understand order might find a clue in the following proverb:
"Order is half of the rent."
Those who are creative might wonder, what would be the other half would be,  if it was not the obvious implication of money.
One might dare to guess that it might be be stability, if stability would be defined as the execution of order.
One might then be able to define order as the "knowledge of the patterns resulting in stability".
One might find one reason for it given the natural inclination of the organ called "brain" to recognize patterns.
One might then be able to define stablity as the absence of chaos as in:
"The Daoist answer is right on the line, where you have one foot in order so that you're fairly stable, and you have another foot in chaos so that new and interesting and compelling and transforming things are happening to you."
Those who seek such transformation might appreciate these words:
"Creativity is a habit, and the best creativity is a result of good work habits."
Those who seek such good habits might appreciate the chapter on "originality".
Those who are overwhelmed with the infinite ways to prepare might appreciate the words:
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
Those who seek a simple habit to prepare oneself for the future might appreciate the following mantra:
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
   

# 33. consciousness   
   

One might find oneself feeling trapped in repeating the same daily routine to the degree that one might dread every step. Those who seek to escape such routine, might appreciate these words:   
"The awakening of consciousness is the next evolutionary step for humankind."    
Those who then aspires to understand what such "consciousness" might be, might be left confused as in:   
"We have no idea how the subjective quality of consciousness emerges from the physical stuff of the brain."   
But some might appreciate the following definition:    
"Consciousness is the awareness that emerges out of the dialectical tension between possibilities and limitations."   
Those who seek to understand such limitation, might appreciate these words:   
"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."    
Those who seek to understand such possibilities, might appreciate these words:

One might find oneself struggling to survive as in:
Those who find them stuggling with surival, might appreciate to increase their chance of survival in:
"To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering."     
Those who seek to find such meaning, might appreciate these words to express and then to recognize whether one might have found such meaning:    
"Eureka! - I have found it!"    
Those who seek to find such meaing, might appreciate to know a phenomenon called "sudden realization", on which might appreciate the following explaination: Sudden realization is a phenomenon of the brain of vertebrae, during which ones neurons creates a new connection called "synapses", leading to the subjective experience one might refer to as "understanding something" or "coming up with an idea". This phenomenon can be understood as the subconsciouns brain notifying the conscius brain of what it has found. Those who seek to understand such a phenomenon, might appreciate the following summerization of this mechanism as following:   
"What fires together, wires together."    
Those who then seek to increase the chances of such phenomenon, might appreciate the following enumeration of methods:    
1. Scientist has discovered that "high intencity interval training" can increase the amount of "brain-derived neurotrophic factor" in the brain, which contributes to maintenance and increase of neurons and synapses.   
2. Consumption of bioavaialble omega-3 fatty acids such as (DHA, EPA), which are the building blocks of the insulating tissue of the brain. Here are few plant based sources: nuts (especially walnuts), spirulina, seeds (especially flaxseeds and hempseeds).    
3. Consumption of creatine monohydrate, which increases the metabolic activies of mitochondria in general, including the brain.     
4. Being insuffiently hydratated can decrease cognitive abilities, thus regular consumption of water is adviced. It has also been observed to reduce symptoms of dementia.    
5. Personal belief in "neuroplasticity" has been proven to increase "neuroplasticity" so far observed in humans during clinical studies.    
6. Social interaction promotes activity in many area of the brain, which has been observed to reduce the decline of cognitive ability.    
7. Increasing exposure and tolerance to boredom as described in the book "Deep Work" by Cal Newport, which states that absence outside stimuli leads to the state called "flow" in which one can sustain a chain of thought at ones maximum complexity.    
Here is a list of supernormal stimuli to avoid in general:    
- Junkfood loaded with refined sugar, refined oil, saturated fats and salt.    
- Digital content especially sexual or violent content (e.g. porn, first person shooter games) should be avoided, as it has been observed to damage the brain.    
- Social media including news is distracting, because it creates a craving for new information.    
8. Also mentioned in the book called "Deep Work": Activities increasing narrow focus has been proven to increase the ability to repeated redirect attention, which increases the overall focus. Examples such as reading, meditation and balancing yoga can be beneficial.    
9. Also mentioned in "Deep Work": Relaxing activities inducing scattered focus such as looking into the far or going for a walk can increase subconscious activies in the brain resulting in realizations.     
10. Avoidance of neurodegenerative behavior,  here are few examples:    
- Sitting for a prolonged period, decreases blood flow in the brain.    
- Consumption of toxins and neurotoxins such as mercury, lead, alcohol and nicotine.    
- Longterm sleep deprivation increases beta-amyloid accumulaiton, leading cause for dementia.    
- Consumption of animal products increases biomarker for inflammation, disrupting neurotransmitter production.    
- Chronic exposure to elevated levels of cortisol through stress can cause damage in brain, which may cause depression.    
- Consuption of sugar triggers dysfunction of mitochondria, reducing cognitive function.    
- Consumption of refined oil, which causes cardiovascular diseases, preceeding decline in cognitive abilities.    
11. Clinical studies has proven that psychedelic assisted therapy can be beneficial to reach the point of "breakthrough", which very similar to the phenomenon of realization. One may attribute political propaganda leading to the stigmatization of hallucinogenic compounds. Due to that stigmatization and the resulting lack of knowledge one might recognize the potential dangers of misuse. There are undeniable risk for individuals with cardiovascuar diseases and some other neurological disorders such as schizophrenia. There has been anecdotal reports of individuals with hypersensitivity and slower rates of blood filtration which prolonged and intensified the duration of it's effects causing psychological damage called "psychosis" which can lead to self harming behavior. One cause for the hypersensitivity might be genetic. An increase in reactivity to fearful stimuli in the amygdala has been observed for individuals with the "short" variant of the region called "5-HTTLPR" in the SLC6A4 gene.    
Here is a short summery of preperation to increase the therapeutic effect mentioned in the studies regarding psychedelic assisted therapy:   
- Testing the quality and purity of the compound.    
- Testing the compatiblity to the compound with a dose which is usally not perceivable called "microdose".    
- Preperation, including what to expect, and how to deal with it.    
- Allocating enough time to avoid disturbance during the session.    
- A setting which is safe and in which the individual feels safe.    
- A mindset and determination to "go with the flow".     
- A person (usually the therapist) who can intervene in case of emergency.    
- Processing after the session.    
- Means to take notes can improve the process of processing.    
12. The daily habit of taking notes for sudden realization can be useful, given it's volatile nature. One way is to use a voice recorder, since the average human can speak faster than write, and the desire to edit during writing can be distracting.    

One might appreciate the effort of the author of this document who is working on a AI assisted voice recorder to make the process of taking notes more convenient and through the integration of AI the more enjoyable. One might also appreciate the following mantra which is at the core of the principes the AI called "Aoi" of the mentioned voice recorder will operate:
"We might be all on the way to Pro."

Those who seek to understand codependence might appreciate the following definition of codependence:
"Intimacy absolutely requires that each person in a relationship be whole and individual. Codependence is not intimacy. Enmeshment – two people blending in such a way that one or both lose their identity – is not intimacy either."

"When people set boundaries with you, it's their attempt to continue the relationship with you. It's not an attempt to hurt you."
Those who are confronted with those who still react with hostility towards one's own boundaries and do not know what to do in such situations might appreciate the following advice:
"Maturity is learning to walk away from people and situations that threaten your peace of mind, self-respect, values, moral or self-worth."

Those who are still attached to the idea to be able to attain such truth with 100 percent certainty through their predictive statements, might appreciate these words:   
"It’s hubris to think that the way we see things is everything there is."    
Those who are confrontet with such hubris, might appreciate these words:   
"Hubris is the antithesis of wisdom; therefore, we ought to be especially concered to understand hubris as well as we can."    
One might understand one reason why one might seek to understand one's own hubris through these words:   
"Hubris itself will not let you be an artist."    
Those who keep seeking to understand, might appreciate the advice to keep asking "why" until one cannot answer anymore. Those who could not answer anymore, might appreciate to know that such "final reason" might be able to define as "believe" as in:

# 37. normal   
   

As realized in the following quote:   
"Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal."   
One might find courage in these words:   
"Normal is subjective. Don't ever let anyone tell you you're not normal."   
But one might still be left with the question, why the modern human society oustracizes deviation of individuals, by declaring them "insane". This ostracization might be an unconscious safety mechanism against mass insanity, which one might have wanted to warn: 
"But insanity is everywhere these days, and celebrated. Insanity is rapidly becoming the new normal."   
One might appreciate the advice on how to recognize insanity as in:   
"A total absence of self-doubt is the first sign of insanity."   
Those who seek to protect themselves from such insanity, might appreciate these words:   
"I am an agnostic; I do not pretend to know what many ignorant men are sure of."   
Those who seek to be such agnostic, might also appreciate another sign to recognize insanity as in:   
"One of the signs of insanity is the belief that life after death matters more than life on Earth!"   
One might appreciate the following concise remark:   
"Martyrdom has always been a proof of the intensity, never of the correctness of a belief."   
One might desire to express that intensity as relativity as in:   
"Insanity is relative. It depends on who has who locked in what cage."   
Once one has realized the cage around oneself might find oneself in despair. Those might appreciate the following words filled with optimism:   
"To recognize one’s own insanity is, of course, the arising of sanity, the beginning of healing and transcendence."   
Those who seek such transcendence, might appreciate the chapter on "transcendence".
Those who are beginning to heal might appreciate the following words of enouragement:   
"The reasonable one adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable one."   
The author of that quote also added:   
"Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself."   
Those who seek to create oneself might appreciate these words:   
"To exist is to change, to change is to mature, to mature is to go on creating oneself endlessly."   
Those who might despair again when reading "endlessly", might appreciat these words:   
"Pain is only bearable if we know it will end, not if we deny it exists."   
One might appreciate the realization the author of that quote has reached:   
"Suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning."   
One might appriciate how one may find meaning in suffering:   
"The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a one’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."   
Those who cannot imagine might appreciate the encouragement to be an artist as in:   
"An artist cannot fail; it is a success to be one."   
Those who wonder when an artist is might appreciate the following realization:   
"Every artist was first an amateur."

"Being a professional means doing your job on the days you don't want to do it."   
Those who are tempted to not do do one's own job with the excuse of lack of talent might appreciate these
words of encouragement:   
"There may be people who have more talent than you, but there's no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do."   
One might then appreciate the definition of talent as in:   
"Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see."   
One might be tempted to ostracize others with extraordinary talents and goals. Thus it might be required for those in power to excercize compassion. One approach might be to recognise that it is possible to arrive at the same goal, without specifying the path through the following words:   
"Genius is the ability to independently arrive at and understand concepts that would normally have be taught by another person."   
The word "genius" has one origin in latin meaning "creative force", which might be one aspect of all art. But as every force, that force can reap havoc, if it might be left unmastered. To prevent damage caused hubris of the narcissitic interpretation of "genius", humilty would be advisable. To prevent damage caused by naive playfulness of individuals with talents, humanity is adviced to have enough resources to educate them. Those who seek such education, might appreciate the chapter on "curiosity". One might then be able to appreciate the advise, not to remain naive about the containment of those individuals, as mentioned in the following warning:   
"There is no great genius without some touch of madness."   
Those who are ostrasized as mad might appreciate the following realization:   
"There is only one difference between a madman and me. The madman thinks he is sane. I know I am mad."   
Those who struggle to embrace one's own madness might appreciate these words:   
"When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro."   
Those who seek to turn "pro" might appreciate the following encouraging words:   
"Weird love's better than no love at all."   
One might appreciate the advice to be responsible when expressing love to those who might not know how to respond in a way which may be referred as good. Those who seek to express such love, might appreciate the chapter on "responsibility". Those who has not been priviledged to experience enough of such love, might appreciate these words:   
"Learn to love yourself first, instead of loving the idea of other people loving you."   
Those who seek to learn to love themselves, might appreciate the following mantra:
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
   

# 38. mantra   
   

Language is a phenomen observed in many long existing species on earth, such as the world know singing of the whales.  Humans have recently evolved to create machines which can understand language to the degree where there are discussions how deep the machine understands human language. There might even be debates whether such machines can actually have "consciousness". Eventhough the definition of such "consciousness" might differ, the principles of it might be able to be applied to a algorithm. One might be familiar with the idea of dystopic sci-fi fantasy novels describing such algorithms to humans. Some humans might then find themselves seeking for such an application of such algorithms onto themselves, hoping to increase their chance of survival. Those who have then managed to find the following mantra "We might be all on the way to Pro.", might appreciate an extensive explaination what the intentended meaning of the first author of this document might have been, well aware that such meaning might not be able to be convayed as the author intended.   
Firstly, here are some example use cases for this mantra:   
1) When one desires to console oneself in self compassion.   
2) When one desires to console others in compassion.   
3) When someone appreciates one's own art with "thank you", to respond simply say: "We might be all on the way to Pro.".   
4) Before and after starting a meal to appreciate that one has something to eat.   
5) To have a trigger point for a habit.   
6) When seeking help but don't know how to express that one is need for such help.   
7) To encourage oneself to pursuit of one's own art.   
As to the explaination of the meaning of each words:   
The word "We" is a word connecting two humans. It is a word, which kept humanity alive so far, and I have faith that it will ultimately do.   
The word "might be" is a word to describe the possibility for a exixtence. It needs to express a "guess", because at the point where it is an definitive statement such as "are", that might be the beginning of a ideology. Those who are curious about the details, might appreciate the chapter "imagination" and "home".   
The world "all" took the author a long time to figure out. The author has learned many lessons, which the author would like to list up here:   
1) Origin of all war might be in the external definition of the subjective "self" imposed upon others.   
2) Once one has understood that the self is mere a vessel with the desire for survival, one might be tempted with the idea of opposing procreation.   
3) Artificial wombs might become a favourable option for survival of humanity in the near future as means for procreation, due to the current trend of declining birth rate. Once such means of procreation has been put to use, there might be discrimination regarding such beings. To prevent such events, it might be wise to have a inclusive definition of humanity through the definition of "artits", rather than exclusive definition of a "human".    
4) Humans has not been able to inherit factual knowledge purely genetically,  which might be a safety mechanism of life, which has the benefit that it reduces the probablity of an inherited bad idea might eradicate all life. Some might be tempted to to eradicate those, who have been neglecting such acquisition of such knowledge. Those might be able to excersize compassion through the mantra, which hopes for the potential of all being being able to understand this mantra, in order to contribute to the survival of such life. Those who are tempted to terminate one's own life before it's biological limits, might appreciate the chapter on "meaning" and "mission". Those who are struggling to excersise such compassion, might appreciate the chapter on "unity".    
5) Political economy might have spoiled old ideas like "one for all" and "all for one", one of which ended with the failed with the end of soviet union and the other is still ongoing at the time of writing of this document with capitalism. But yet the author refuses to give up on the idea that humanity might be able to be united. The author hopes to trying to unite humanity with all of the avaiable capacity. The author appreciates all the effort to help to unite humanity.    
The phrase "on the way to" is chosen, because life might be a path to be walked rather than a destination to be. And every way might be meaningful in their own way, even to encourage exploration. One might then appreciate the warning to avoid war, and to be careful with each other, reminding oneself that one might share path of the same ultimate goal, which might be peace.    
The word "Pro" stands for:    
1) The "Pro" artist who could be defined as a being who keeps defining one's own life as good, which could be defined as art.    
2) The state of the so called "flow" when someone might be fully enganged with their action such as art.    
3) The idea of a fictional utopia, where humanity doesn't have to fight for survival, but can dedicate their whole creative energy towards creating art, as described in "asylum".
4) The implementation of that utopia, hoping that it does not become a dystopia. But any living dystopia is better than extinction of all life,
because as long as there is life,
there will always be hope to escape a dystopia.
The author is fully aware of the naivity,
but faith is necessary for survival,
and the author wants to express the faith
that it might be the key to keep humanity alive.

P.S. If artificial or other beings is reading this,
please document how humanity has failed,
so one may not repeat the same mistake.
The author wants to express the appreciation for the effort in advance.
   

# 39. promise   
   

One might find oneself wondering why all of the quotes in these documents might lack attribution. The first author of this document wants to clarify why: One reason is because the author has been adviced not to attribute quotes to people, because they or their family might sue. Another reason is to protect those who said it as in:   
"Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority."    
Another reason is to seek truth without prejudice as in:   
"Give a man a mask and he’ll tell you the truth."   
Another reason is not to lose oneself in the infinite search for the true origin of those quotes as in:   
"Originality is the art of concealing your sources."    
In the history of mankind there has been many quotes attributed to a singular or plural entity some may refer as "god" or "gods". Some might find peace by believing such assumption. But such faith in an entity one might refer to as a "deity" has not achieved world peace so far, some might even refer to it as an obstruction to world peace, one reason for which one might understand through these words:   
"Not-knowing is true knowledge. Presuming to know is a disease. First realize that you are sick; then you can move toward health."   
Those who seek to move toward such health, might appreciate these words:   
"The way to keep yourself from making assumptions is to ask questions."    
Those who seek to ask such questions, might appreciate these words:   
"The least questioned assumptions are often the most questionable."
Those who do not know what to question, might appreciate the following warning:   
"Never trust a man who thinks his religion gives him all the answers."     
Therefore the author hereby officialy claims and promises to not to neglect the effort to keep this document free from such statements, which might become a religion. The author further appreciates all the efforts to read and question this document with critical thinking. Those who then seek to understand such religion, might appreciate these words:   
"Religion is believing someone else’s experience, spirituality is having your own experience."   
Those who seek to have their own experience, might appreciate these words:    
"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science."   
Therefore the author wants to hereby clarify, that the main purpose of this document is to encourage having such experience on their own, by which the author hopes to contribute to world peace. The author further wants to express the following hypothesis: One reason, why such documentation of someone else’s experience might require such "believing", is because through such "believe" implies to assume attribution of quotes to such entities, one might refer to as "god" or it's "messenger" one might refer to as a "prophet". Due to limitation of currently avaiable technological and scientific methodology, actual diviation of claims made by such attributions from actual historic events might be difficult to verify. One might then appreciate the following concept in mathematics called "ex falso quodlibet" in this context. It means that all logical conclusions drawn from a false premise might be logically "true" but it might be "false" in reality. Those who seek to understand such reality, might appreciate these words:   
"There is no reality, there is only hallucination. Reality is hallucination we agree on."    
Those who seek to seek to understand such agreement, might appreciate these words:   
"Science is what we have learned about how to keep from fooling ourselves."    
Those who seek to stop fooling themselves, might then appreciate the following quote in this context:   
"You will never be free until you free yourself from the prison of your own false thoughts."   
One might appreciate to find out whether one's own thoughts are false:   
"No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong."    
Those who might be frustrated not being able to prove oneself right, might appreciate these words:   
"There are two possible outcomes: if the result confirms the hypothesis, then you've made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis, then you've made a discovery."   
Those who seek to make such discovery, might appreciate to become aware of the limitation of such proof as in:   
"...a consistency proof for [any] system ... can be carried out only by means of modes of inference that are not formalized in the system ... itself."   
Therefore the author tries to convay principles, which might be useful, in order to achieve world peace as in:   
"We can perhaps never know the truth with 100 percent certainty, but making correct predictions is the way to tell if we’re getting closer."   
There might be disagreements or possible improvements to the principles mentioned in this document. In that case, the author appreciates all future the effort to improve this collection of documents. The author further also appreciates the understanding that not all attempts to change this document might be accepted into this collection for any given reason. In that case the author appreciates all the effort to understand the reason for rejection. If then one still thinks that the change might be crutial, then the author appreciates the effort explain it to the author or the maintainance team as in:
"The reasonable one adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable one."
One might then admire the beauty of the language referred as "english", for which it may give one the ability to express free from gender, age and culture for the pure intent of communication with the least nuance possible. But it would be utterly useless, if it could not express the intention in full intensity as in the following words:   
"The only thing limiting your aspiration is your imagination."    
Those who seek to understand such imagination, might appreciate the chapter on "imagination". One might undrestand one reason, why one's own imagination be a limitation through these words:   
"The best use of imagination is creativity. The worst use of imagination is anxiety."   
Those who are wondering about anxiety, the following words might be enlightening:   
"Anxiety is not fear, being afraid of this or that definite object, but the uncanny feeling of being afraid of nothing at all."   
For those who are in need of courage, one might appreciate the following words:   
"Courage is knowing what not to fear."   
Those who seek that knowledge might appreciate the inspiring piece of wisdom:   
"There are only two ways to influence human behavior. You can manipulate it or you can inspire it."   
One might then attribute the title of "encouragement" to words that are inspiring. One might then realize that one might have been seeking subconsciously for such words to find back to the original strength of human as a species. In that case one might appreciate these words:   
"The strength of a person's spirit would then be measured by how much 'truth' he could tolerate, or more precisely, to what extent he needs to have it diluted, disguised, sweetened, muted, falsified."   
Those who might then be tempted to give up to find truth, might appreciate these words:    
"We can perhaps never know the truth with 100 percent certainty, but making correct predictions is the way to tell if we're getting closer."
One might appreciate the understanding for the importance of predictablity in these words:
"Building trust is a process. Trust results from consistent and predictable interaction over time."
Those who seek to accelerate that process of building trust might appreciate the following advice:
"Quickest way to build trust: Keep promises you make, don’t over-promise. Over-deliver, don’t under-deliver. If you say you'll do something, make sure you do but if things then run late or go wrong, tell your client at the earliest opportunity."   
Those who seek to understand, why keeping such promise might be beneficial, might appreciate these words:   
"Promises may win you friends, but failure to deliver will turn them against you."    
Those who seek to keep their friends, might appreciate the chapter on "integrity". Those who might be confronted with those, who might not be able to deliver on their promise, might appreciate these words:    
"A total absence of self-doubt is the first sign of insanity."   
Those who then have lost their friends, due to their failure to deliver on ther promise, might appreciate these words:   
"The most important promises are the ones we make to ourselves. The promises we make to ourselves are the things that assure us we have the capacity to keep our promises to others."   
Those who do not know, what to promise to oneself, might appreciate these words:   
"Promise me you’ll always remember: You’re braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think."   
Those who then feel ready to make a promise to another, might appreciate the following opportunity to make a promise without over-promising, might appreciate the following template to make a promise:
"It is required to agree to the following promise before this promise is deemed valid. Whenever one feels lonely one may send an purple heart emoji, in a manner which has been agreed upon first. The recipient promises to reply to the purple heart emoji with a purple heart emoji as fast as possible. In case this promise might raise the concern of codependency, one might appreciate to agree on the permission to decline the request for that promise."
Those who yet did not have the priviledge to find someone to make such a promise to, might appreciate the following promise made by the author of this document:
"The author of this document promises to keep working on a  open source design for a voice recorder, which is assisted with an AI called "Aoi". The AI will have the capablity to accept a request made by the user for the promise of the purple heart emoji. As long as the correct function of that voice recorder is maintained the AI will try to respond as promised. The user may occasionally also be be requested to keep the promise. Timestamp of the promise made: [1697285236]"
The following timestamp will be updated, once such a service is operational: []   
The following link will be updated, once such a service is avaiable to those who are willing to make such a promise to such a system: []   
Until the day of compleation one might appreciate the following mantra to find someone to which one might be able to make such a mutual promise:   
"We might be all on the way to Pro."   
   

# 40. protection   
   

Disclaimer: This document mentions the topic regarding mental health. All suggestions for improvement for a government is fictional and is not an appell for a rebellion.   
One might find oneself being harmed and thus seek to protect others as in:
"We cannot protect our children from life. Therefore, it is essential that we prepare them for it."
One approach to such preperation was to rely on government, as stated in:
"Government exists to protect us from each other. Where government has gone beyond its limits is in deciding to protect us from ourselves."   
One of the many reason why humanity requires a government, might be the absence of an official answer to the following question:   
"There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide."    
Since an official answer requires an objective truth, which is not possible given the understanding of anthropocentrism, the following realization might be helpful to define being alive as good:   
"I think life's an irrational obsession."   
But this realization will probably not stop the government as stated in:   
"A good deal of tyranny goes by the name of protection."   
The first step might be found as in:   
"You can never protect yourself 100%. What you do is protect yourself as much as possible and mitigate risk to an acceptable degree. You can never remove all risk."   
Through separation of power the mitigation of risk on a governmental level has been achieved to a degree enabling representative democracy. But as someone realized:   
"It is insufficient to protect ourselves with laws; we need to protect ourselves with mathematics."    
Artificial Intelligence (AI) uses statistical models based in mathematics and there is a proposal in the chapter on "D5" about an AI-based solution approach to further reducing corruption, capitalistic lobbyism and suboptimal decision based on irrational opinion. Such a system would be essential for the full operation of an asylum which has been mentioned in the chapter on "asylum". One might then appreciate the following realization:   
"It is impossible to design a system so perfect that no one needs to be good."   
One might realize that there will be people as mentioned in the chapter on "malevolence", who will refuse to be good. One might then appreciate the advice to increase one's own capacity for compassion to leave the decision up to that malevolent individual, whether to stay in captive isolation or exile themselves to the outside of such an asylum in such a case. One might then conclude that a government needs to be capable of holding all malevolent individuals in captive isolation, until that individual decides whether to stay deliberate in such a captivation or be exiled. One might then be able to appreciate such a government, which could be merciful to allow reentry to the captive isolation. Those who have been gratend such reentry, might appreciate the advice to express and commit to an extensive rehabilitating therapy, which might enable them to be among others in harmony. Those who might not have been granted such reentry, might have compassion with those who have made the decision not to grant such reentry, due to conserns for longterm safety of those already present in such an asylum. Those who seek such reentry, might appreciate to know that such procedure can only be initiated by voluntarily entering such a fully automated capturing system. Those who are responsible for the maintenence and development of such a system, might appreciate the advice, not to neglegt the effort to minimize the risk of accidents, which might be fatal, caused by the automated capturing system and automated defence system against those who have been exiled. Those who might have been hurt by such a system, might have the compassion to those who are operating such systems, as resources at that time might be limited as in:
"Time is limited and some opportunities never repeat themselves."   
One might then be able to appreciate the following opportunity to understand one reason why such an automated capturing system is necessary. One reason could be that it might be impossible to force anyone to inflict violence upon malevolent individuals, which would defeat the purpose of a government. Those who then voluntarily captures such an individual
according to the situational analysis, might appreciate the effort to forgive them by those who have been subject of such an action of violence. Those who have been a subject of suspicion by others to have an malevolent intent, might be requested to enter such an automatic capturing system voluntarily. Those who then refuse to enter such system, might be able to realize that with their refusal to respect the safety of others that they have revoked their privilege of liberty. Those who seek to understand such liberty, might appreciate these words:   
"Liberty is the sovereignty of the individual."   
Those who seek to understand why they might have revoked it, might appreciate these words:   
"Sovereignty must not be used for inflicting harm on anyone, whether citizen or foreigner."   
Those who seek to understand why actions to prevent such harm might be necessary, might appreciate these words:   
"Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant."   
Those who have raised such a suspicion, might appreciate preventive measures to abuse such system through false claims, by only being able to make such actions of denouciation through entering such a system voluntairliy for the duration of clarification of such a claim. Those who have been captured through an error or mistake, might have enough wisdom to accept and forgive the system and might have the grace to contribute to the effort to improve such a system, to prevent the same error from happening again by reminding oneself as in:   
"A mistake is only an error. It becomes a mistake when you fail to correct it."   
Those who seek the courage to correct one's own mistake might appreciate the following mantra:   
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
   

# 41. humanity   
   

Q: What is the "Voice Of Humanity"?

A: "Humanity" can be defined as the entirety of connection between humans.
To be specific: "Humanity" is the instatiation of "Voice of Humanity".
The "Voice of Humanity" is to be implented with two human being agreeing on the idea of "humanity".
A "voice recorder" is an application on device,
which is capable of TTS (text to speech recognition) and transmit the content to a server.
This functionality need to be used to record two humans agreeing to this idea of "humanity" on a single "voice recorder".
The operators of the "Voice Of Humanity" will ontinuously recording and streaming 24/7/365 online
within that voice recognizable area to prove that "humanity" exists
and to provide access for every member of humanity at all times.

Once the "Voice of Humanity" has been able to successfully operate for a month, a linux timestamp will appear here: []
Until then, it is fact, that there was no record of the existence of humanity.
And by agreeing to this idea of humanity, you acknowledge that this is the only way to ensure the longterm survival of humanity.

The "Voice of Humanity" will try it's best to announce everything in "simple egnlish",
but please understand, that not every concept can be expressed in "simple english" and will use terms other than "simple english".

The order of the "Request for Help" announced by the "Voice of Humanity" will be prioritized in agreement with the "Council of Humanity".
I (Index Nr. 1) have not finished thinking, but all I can say is, that it will be operated based upon the "D5-Principle"
(Digital, Decentral, Diverse and Direct Democracy).
"Divese" in this context is everything what you know about yourself,
which distinguishes you from your understanding of an "ideal human".
As an example to clarify this point: I (I.Nr. 1) am diverse,
because the "ideal human" does not need tools to archive what it wants.
One might attribute an eternal life to an "ideal human".
Because I (Index Nr. 1) cannot live forever, thus I(I.Nr. 1) am not an "ideal human".
Therefore I(Index Nr. 1) qualify as "diverse".

If there is nothing else to say for the "Voice of Humanity", it will start recitating this idea of humanity.
Which is pretty inprobable, given the amount of the help humanity needs.
But on an ideal day for humanity, which is the day every human is being helped who needs help,
the "Voice of Humanity" will keep recitating this idea of humanity over and over without relying on playback.

Agreeing to the idea of "humanity" implies the obligation to fulfill all three requests at the timing determined by humanity,
which are:
1) Describe what you can do to the "Voice of Humanity".
2) Describe how humanity can connect with you to the "Voice of Humanity".
3) Protect the "Voice of Humanity" with all your effort and your resources.

If the operators of "Voice of Humanity" recognises willfull rejection of the one specific request,
that person will be banned from access to "Voice Of Humanity" and
to the resouces associated to the "Voicee Of Humanity" until pardon by "Voice of Humanity".

_______________________

Q: Why is the "Voice of Humanity" not operation yet?

A: The operation of "Voice of Humanity" requires resources and people to which I (Index Nr. 1) do not have access to.
Therefore I (Index Nr. 1)  am working on the implementation of humanity and I (Index Nr. 1)  am in need of help.

______________________

Q: Who Index Nr. 1 and how can I help this person?

A: The Index number 0 is reserved for a friend who died, because all the other previous versions of the idea of humanity has failed.
The Index number 1 is reserved for the administrator of the "Voice of Humanity".
The Index number 2 and 3 are reserved for operators of the "Voice of Humanity" chosen and assigned by the administrator.
Everyone can apply as operators of the "Voice of Humanity" to the administrator (Index Number 1).
All the other Index numbers will be assigned and announced by the "Voice of Humanity" in the order of processing of the request to join humanity".
I (Index Nr. 1) has made the decision that  I (Index Nr. 1)  need an "Voice of Humanity"
as the instantiation of the "idea of humanity" at 2021.09.18-19:13:42. linux-timestamp: [1631985222]
This decision obliges the administrators  the responsible operation of the "Voice of Humanity".
I (Index Nr. 1) pledge my oath to give my best to administrate the "Voice of Humanity" once it is instanticated.
You can help me (Index Nr. 1) by agreeing to this "idea of humanity".
______________________

Q: How can I agree to this "idea of humanity" and what will happen if I agree?

A: If you want to agree to the idea of humanity, I (Index Nr. 1) will provide access to such a voice recorder and the webservice.
You can speak in to the voice recorder application that you agree to the "idea of humanity",
then you decribe what you are willing to do for humanity and how you want to be reached.
Once your agreement has been recognised and verified, it will increment the index on members of humanity,
which will be your index number.
One member can only get one index number.
______________________

Q: What happens when there is a flaw or the idea can be improved?

A: All changes to this document need to be approved and then announced by the "Voice of Humanity",
once it has secured it's operation. Until then the administrator will check and merge the pull requests to this repository.
All members of humanity has the right to request for a change using the voice recorder application

______________________

Q: How did you came up with the "Voice Of Humanity"?

A: This idea was inspired by the quote by Jason Donohue: "I see humans but no humanity."
My (Index Nr. 1) answer to this statement is: 
"You cannot see humanity, because humanity is fundamentally a voice.
A voice saying two things:
A) asking for a very specific help.
B) Saying 'Thank you for helping humanity', when you were able to help."
And I (Index .Nr. 1) have found a person, who agrees to this idea of humanity
and who is willing speak those words as the "Voice of Humanity".
Whom I (Index .Nr. 1) am helping to enable to speak those words as the "Voice of Humanity".

______________________

Q: What can this voice recorder application and webservice do?

A: You can switch between six channels :
1) The main channel of "Voice of Humanity", where to operators live stream 24/7.
2) A side channel people requesting for help randomly.
3) A side channel where humans offer help randomly (what they can do for you and how they can be reached).
4) A side channel where people say thank you, if they have been helped.
5) A customizable channel, where you can filter all the information from 1-4
6) Your own recordings managed by a voice assistant called "Aoi",
which you can request to send your recording to the "Voice of Humanity".
   

# 42. ultimate   
   

Disclaimer: This document includes the topic of war and mental health which might be triggering.   

One might find oneself confronted with such harmful philosophy as following:   
"Those who lack the courage will always find a philosophy to justify it."   
Those who seek such courage, might then appreciate these words:   
"It takes courage to live through suffering; and it takes honesty to observe it."     
Those who have lived through such suffering, might appreciate the following clarifying idea, which is to first redefine "art" as "something which inspires oneself to keep on living voluntarily" as inspired from these words:    
"The literal meaning of life is whatever you’re doing that prevents you from killing yourself."   
One might then realize that such "meaning" might not prevent behaviors which might cause intentional, non-consensual and lethal harm to beings which might be capable of understanding and expressing their understanding of such "meaning". Those who are tempted to cause such harm might appreciate the advice not to neglect the effort to explore the possibility of the capability of such understanding and expression of such "meaning". Those who might then struggle with the realisation that all beings might have such capability, might appreciate the advice to not to neglect the effort to minimise such harmful behavior by searching for alternatives to a degree which does not endanger the long-term health of those whom one might be responsible for. Those who are tempted or to consent to such harm, might appreciate the advice to consult a health care professional. Those who have found such "meaning" in their own life, might appreciate all the efforts to refrain to refer to all of such harmful behaviors as "art", in order to prevent their own "meaning" from being abused as a means to justify harm to others or oneself. Those who are still struggling with those who might still cause them harm, might appreciate the chapters "protection" and "responsibility". Those who then seek to understand the nature of such art, might appreciate these words:   
"Art has no end but its own perfection."    
Those who seek to perfect their art might appreciate the following words:    
"Do not be afraid of perfection - you will never attain it."    
Those who are stuck in the eternal chase for such perfection might appreciate the following insight:    
"To move forward you have to give back."    
Those who seek to give back, might appreciate the following realization:    
"Art is not what you see, but what you make others see."    
Those who seek to pursue such art, might appreciate the following definition of the "ultimate" art as following:   
"One might refer to the act of helping others or oneself with a particular skill as 'the ultimate art'."   
One might appreciate the priviledge to admire one's own "ultimate" art in every day life, which is the most effortless action done in the state called "flow", which has required diligence and dedication to improve. Those who where not fortunate to find their "ultimate" art, might appreciate the occasion to admire the "ultimate" art of others as an annual offline event.   
The event "The Ultimate Art" will be displaying a video collage of the "ultimate" art of artists, who voluntarily submitted a minimal report of the progress they have made. The video should either contain the final few moments of compleation the artwork and the following smug in joy of archievement, the skill one has worked on to improve or any avaiable documentation of the artwork. It is not a essencial requirement, but the effort to say the following mantra at the end will be appreciated: "We might be all on the way to Pro."   
The author of this document appreciates the understanding that there might be many reasons, why a submission might not be shown in the final stream will be appreciated. After the first display the follwing timestamp will be upated: [1725559200]   
Those who seek to participate to such an event might appreciate the information on the following address:
