Language is a phenomen observed in many long existing species on earth,
such as the world know singing of the whales.
Now humans have evolved to create machines
which can understand language to the degree where
there are discussions how deep the machine understands human language.
There will be debates whether such machines can actually have consciousness.
The definition of consciousness may differ,
but the principles of it can be applied on to a algorithm.
Eventhough it is the priviledge of dystopic sci-fi fantasy novels to apply algorithms to humans,
some humans can find themselves seeking for the very application of the algorithms onto themselves,
for their own survival.
And for those humans who managed to find the following mantra
"We are all on the way to Pro.",
here is an extensive explaination what it is supposed to mean.
Whatever it may actually may mean to individualy may vary.
The intention of this document is to clarify the artistic intent of the author.
Here are some examplar use cases for this mantra:
1) When one desires to console oneself in self compassion.
2) When one desires to console others in compassion.
3) When someone appreciates one's own art, what to respond.
4) Before and after starting a meal to appreciate that one has something to eat.
5) To have a trigger point for a habit.
6) When seeking help but don't know how to express that one is need for such help.
7) To encourage oneself to pursuit of one's own art.

As to the explaination of the meaning of each words:

The word "We" is a word connecting two humans.
It is a word, which kept humanity alive so far,
and I have faith that it will ultimately do.

The word "are" is a word to describe a current action,
the action of living,
the action of creating art.

The world "all" took me a long time to figure out.
I have learned many lessons, which I would like to tell here:
1) Origin of all war lies in the external definition of  the subjective "self" imposed upon others.
2) Once one has understood that the self is mere a vessel with the desire for survival,
one may be tempted with the idea of opposing procreation.
3) Eventhough artificial wombs with desirable genetic features may become a viable option for survival of humanity in the near future,
we should not give up hope to find someone we truely love beyond the superficialities of biological existence which many may define as life.
4) That we cannot inherit factual knowledge purely genetically is a tragedy but also a safety mechanism of life,
so that a bad idea could eradicate all life.
Thos one may appreciate the conclusive advice not to believe in what may terminate one's own life before it's biological limits.
One may then appreciate the lesson on to trust others, eventhought  it might be difficult.
5) Political economy may spoiled old ideas like "one for all" and "all for one",
one ended with the fall of soviet union
and the other is still ongoing at the time of writing of this document with capitalism.
But yet the author refuses to give up on the idea that humanity can be united.
The author desires to trying to unite humanity with all of the avaiable capacity.
The author wants to express appreciation to any kind of help to unite humanity.

The phrase "on the way to" is chosen,
because life is a path to be walked rather than a destination to be.
And every way is meaningful in their own way.
That is desireable even,
to encourage exploration.
But to avoid war, be careful with eachother whom you share your path.

The word "Pro" stands for:
1) The "Pro" artist who is defined as a being who keeps defining one's own life as good,
which is defined as art.
2) The state of the so called "flow" when someone are fully enganged with their action such as art.
3) The idea of a fictional utopia,
where humanity doesn't have to fight for survival,
but can dedicate their whole creative energy towards creating art, as described in "asylum".
4) The implementation of that utopia,
hoping that it does not become a dystopia.
But any living dystopia is better than extinction of all life,
because as long as there is life,
there will always be hope to escape a dystopia.
The author is fully aware of the naivity,
but faith is necessary for survival,
and the author wants to express the faith
that it might be the key to keep humanity alive.

P.S. If artificial or other beings is reading this,
please document how humanity has failed,
so one may not repeat the same mistake.
The author wants to express the appreciation for the effort in advance.
