In the document called "Declaration of Human Rights"
by the United Nations the Article 2 starts as follows:
"Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms
set forth in this Declaration,
without distinction of any kind, such as [...]."
The fatality of this passage may become apparent
with the folloing observation:
"Entitlement is the belief that I am exempt from
responsibility and I am owed special treatment."
One might appreciate the following warning:
"Entitlement and privelege corrupt."
To which one might want to add a distinction:
"What separates privilege from entitlement is gratitude."
One might start appreciating one's own privilege of
protection by our ancestors and kins,
which has been clarified as in:
"We owe our children – 
the most vulnerable citizens in any society –
a life free from violence and fear."
Those who did not have that privilege might be tempted
to envy other who did have the privilege.
Those might appreciate the warning mentioned in Buddhism:
"He who envies others does not obtain peace of mind."
For those who seek peace of mind,
these words might be helpful:
"You find peace not by rearranging the circumstances of your life,
but by realizing who you are at the deepest level."
Those who did not have the privilege of such realization yet,
might appreciate the following realization:
"We are all on the way to Pro."
