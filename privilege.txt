One might be fortunate enough to encounter a document called "Declaration of Human Rights" which starts as following:
"Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as [...]."
Those who might then wonder about the meaning of such "entitlement, might appreciate these words:   
"Entitlement is the belief that I am exempt from responsibility and I am owed special treatment."    
Those who might hold such a belief might appreciate the following warning:
"Entitlement and privelege corrupt."    
Those who might then wonder about the difference between such entitlement and privilege, might appreciate these words:    
"What separates privilege from entitlement is gratitude."    
Those who might then start to appreciate one's own privilege of being protected by our ancestors and kins, might appreciate the following insight:    
"We owe our children – the most vulnerable citizens in any society – a life free from violence and fear."    
Those who did not have such privilege might be tempted to envy others who did have the privilege. Those might appreciate the following warning:
"He who envies others does not obtain peace of mind."    
Those who seek such a peace of mind, might appreciate these words:    
"You find peace not by rearranging the circumstances of your life, but by realizing who you are at the deepest level."
Those who seek to realize one might at such a level, might appreciate the following mantra:
"We are all on the way to Pro."
