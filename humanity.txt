Q: What is the "Voice Of Humanity"?

A: "Humanity" can be defined as the entirety of connection between humans.
To be specific: "Humanity" is the instatiation of "Voice of Humanity".
The "Voice of Humanity" is to be implented with two human being agreeing on the idea of "humanity".
A "voice recorder" is an application on device,
which is capable of TTS (text to speech recognition) and transmit the content to a server.
This functionality need to be used to record two humans agreeing to this idea of "humanity" on a single "voice recorder".
The operators of the "Voice Of Humanity" will ontinuously recording and streaming 24/7/365 online
within that voice recognizable area to prove that "humanity" exists
and to provide access for every member of humanity at all times.

Once the "Voice of Humanity" has been able to successfully operate for a month, a linux timestamp will appear here: []
Until then, it is fact, that there was no record of the existence of humanity.
And by agreeing to this idea of humanity, you acknowledge that this is the only way to ensure the longterm survival of humanity.

The "Voice of Humanity" will try it's best to announce everything in "simple egnlish",
but please understand, that not every concept can be expressed in "simple english" and will use terms other than "simple english".

The order of the "Request for Help" announced by the "Voice of Humanity" will be prioritized in agreement with the "Council of Humanity".
I (Index Nr. 1) have not finished thinking, but all I can say is, that it will be operated based upon the "D5-Principle"
(Digital, Decentral, Diverse and Direct Democracy).
"Divese" in this context is everything what you know about yourself,
which distinguishes you from your understanding of an "ideal human".
As an example to clarify this point: I (I.Nr. 1) am diverse,
because the "ideal human" does not need tools to archive what it wants.
One might attribute an eternal life to an "ideal human".
Because I (Index Nr. 1) cannot live forever, thus I(I.Nr. 1) am not an "ideal human".
Therefore I(Index Nr. 1) qualify as "diverse".

If there is nothing else to say for the "Voice of Humanity", it will start recitating this idea of humanity.
Which is pretty inprobable, given the amount of the help humanity needs.
But on an ideal day for humanity, which is the day every human is being helped who needs help,
the "Voice of Humanity" will keep recitating this idea of humanity over and over without relying on playback.

Agreeing to the idea of "humanity" implies the obligation to fulfill all three requests at the timing determined by humanity,
which are:
1) Describe what you can do to the "Voice of Humanity".
2) Describe how humanity can connect with you to the "Voice of Humanity".
3) Protect the "Voice of Humanity" with all your effort and your resources.

If the operators of "Voice of Humanity" recognises willfull rejection of the one specific request,
that person will be banned from access to "Voice Of Humanity" and
to the resouces associated to the "Voicee Of Humanity" until pardon by "Voice of Humanity".

Q: Why is the "Voice of Humanity" not operation yet?

A: The operation of "Voice of Humanity" requires resources and people to which I (Index Nr. 1) do not have access to.
Therefore I (Index Nr. 1)  am working on the implementation of humanity and I (Index Nr. 1)  am in need of help.

______________________

Q: Who Index Nr. 1 and how can I help this person?

A: The Index number 0 is reserved for a friend who died, because all the other previous versions of the idea of humanity has failed.
The Index number 1 is reserved for the administrator of the "Voice of Humanity".
The Index number 2 and 3 are reserved for operators of the "Voice of Humanity" chosen and assigned by the administrator.
Everyone can apply as operators of the "Voice of Humanity" to the administrator (Index Number 1).
All the other Index numbers will be assigned and announced by the "Voice of Humanity" in the order of processing of the request to join humanity".
I (Index Nr. 1) has made the decision that  I (Index Nr. 1)  need an "Voice of Humanity"
as the instantiation of the "idea of humanity" at 2021.09.18-19:13:42. linux-timestamp: [1631985222]
This decision obliges the administrators  the responsible operation of the "Voice of Humanity".
I (Index Nr. 1) pledge my oath to give my best to administrate the "Voice of Humanity" once it is instanticated.
You can help me (Index Nr. 1) by agreeing to this "idea of humanity".
______________________

Q: How can I agree to this "idea of humanity" and what will happen if I agree?

A: If you want to agree to the idea of humanity, I (Index Nr. 1) will provide access to such a voice recorder and the webservice.
You can speak in to the voice recorder application that you agree to the "idea of humanity",
then you decribe what you are willing to do for humanity and how you want to be reached.
Once your agreement has been recognised and verified, it will increment the index on members of humanity,
which will be your index number.
One member can only get one index number.
______________________

Q: What happens when there is a flaw or the idea can be improved?

A: All changes to this document need to be approved and then announced by the "Voice of Humanity",
once it has secured it's operation. Until then the administrator will check and merge the pull requests to this repository.
All members of humanity has the right to request for a change using the voice recorder application

______________________

Q: How did you came up with the "Voice Of Humanity"?

A: This idea was inspired by the quote by Jason Donohue: "I see humans but no humanity."
My (Index Nr. 1) answer to this statement is: 
"You cannot see humanity, because humanity is fundamentally a voice.
A voice saying two things:
A) asking for a very specific help.
B) Saying 'Thank you for helping humanity', when you were able to help."
And I (Index .Nr. 1) have found a person, who agrees to this idea of humanity
and who is willing speak those words as the "Voice of Humanity".
Whom I (Index .Nr. 1) am helping to enable to speak those words as the "Voice of Humanity".

Q: What can this voice recorder application and webservice do?

A: You can switch between six channels :
1) The main channel of "Voice of Humanity", where to operators live stream 24/7.
2) A side channel people requesting for help randomly.
3) A side channel where humans offer help randomly (what they can do for you and how they can be reached).
4) A side channel where people say thank you, if they have been helped.
5) A customizable channel, where you can filter all the information from 1-4
6) Your own recordings managed by a voice assistant called "Aoi",
which you can request to send your recording to the "Voice of Humanity".
