One might feel gratitude for being able to find
oneself reading the following words:
"Extinction is the rule.
Survival is the exception."
The reason for the extinction might become
apparent in these words:
"When all choice is taken from you,
life becomes a game of survival."
To figure out the rules of that game of
survival, one might appreciate the following realization:
"The most important factor in survival is neither
intelligence nor strength but adaptability."
To which one might add:
"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change."
This insight might lead to the temptation
to desire to become immortal.
There are thee types of biological immortality:
One is resistance to environment
which a species called Tardigrade excell at.
The second is perseverence throught time,
which bacterial spores excell at,
which can be revived from stasis even after
millions of years.
The third is maintenance of active metabolism,
which Pinus longaeva excell at.
Even though their remarkable ability
all of those species still have the ability to procreate.
One might appreciate the privilege being naive,
to procreate regardless the prospect of the offsprings.
But there are many species on earth
which reduces their reproductive behavior
if they recognize the scarecity of resources.
But so far only humans reduce their reproduction
based on abstract concepts such as their
projection of the future or their sense of morality,
which can be referred as "antinatalism".
One might call it tolerance to not disturb those
who have found their peace of their own mind
throught applying antinatalism to their own lives.
One might then feel the desire to counteract the
act of preaching antinatalism to others.
Since censorship would undermine freedom
of speech, without which this very document
would not be possible,
there is a necessity for preperation of counter
arguments to win a debate.
One might appreciate the following definition
for hyprocrisy as in:
"Hyprocrisy is the audacity to preach integrity
from a den of corruption."
It is undeniable that there might be logical
chain of thought in antinatalism.
But it assumes that rationality would be
without flaws which is not, as eloquently said as in:
"The end point of rationality is to demonstrate
the limits of rationality."
Thus one might appreciate the warning about those
who claim their logic to be flawless:
"Ideology is a partial truth masquerading
as the whole truth."
One might appreciate the lessons of history,
how corrupt ideologies can be,
and not to keep repeat those mistakes.
There might be moral arguments,
to which one might reply with the words:
"Never let your sense of morals get in the
way of doing what's right."
One might have compassion with those
who did not have a privileged life.
Those might find hope for the next generation
in these encouraging words:
"For what then matters is to bear witness
to the uniquely human potential at its best,
which is to transform a personal tragedy
into a triumph, to turn oneâ€™s predicament
into a human achievement."
The following realization might inspire such triumph:
"Our survival as a species depends on our ability
to recognize that our well-being and the well-being
of others are in fact one and the same."
One might then feel the desire to help those
who refuse to accept that realization.
Those might appreciate the following wisdom:
"You can't help people that don't want to be helped."
For the case that those who denied the first offer to help,
change their mind and seek help,
saying the following mantra may offer an opportunity to reconsile:
"We are all on the way to Pro."
