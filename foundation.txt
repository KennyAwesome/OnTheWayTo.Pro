One might appreciate the following realization:
"Integrity is the foundation upon which
all other values are built."
One might appreciate the following description of integrity:
"Integrity is a life where your beliefs and intentions
are aligned with your words and actions."
Humanity has invented an organization called a "government"
which aligns the words as laws and the actions by law enforcement.
Given the nature of such power to corrupt,
one might then aspire to a new kind of organization,
such as the "Foundation" described in the book with the same title.
In most countries with a democratic government,
there is an form for organization called a "foundation".
The details of laws regarding such foundations may vary,
but they have in common that it can define rules for the member
of such foundation called "foundation statutes",
which will be enforced through the govermental law enforcement.
This mechanism can be utilized to minimize the risk of corrupt
members of such an foundation.
Those members of foundation with integrity
might volunteer to hep reducing corruption in the
legislative part of the government by ensuring the correct
operation of the systems for D5.
Each instanciation of such organization will be specific to
the targeting government, but here is an exemplar foundation statutes
anyone is free to use.
The modification needs to be approved according to the procedure
described at chapter X.X:
