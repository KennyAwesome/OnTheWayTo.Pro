Disclaimer: This is a hypothetical essay of an artist, the effort to prevent this document from being classified as terrorism will be appreciated.   
   
There is a necessity for action beyond appreciation, when one has fully grasped meaning of the following words:
"Life asks of every individual a contribution, and it is up to that individual to discover what it should be."
For one life becomes increasingly demanding so much so that one might feel the temptation to contemplate about and asylum from that demand of life.
One name for that utopia might be "artsylum",a neologism from the word art and asylum. The idea for that word was derived from the ancient greek word "asylum", which can be translated to "unrobbed". For that utopia to be actualized, at least the following five criteria need to be met, before one may refer to it as "artsylum". There is one exception to that rule, which is as follows:
"Any shelter with at least a microwave with intact power supply may qualify as a "atelier", offering food for artists while collecting resources for the actual implementation".
1. Fully renewable power source, especially nuclear fusion   
2. Full automation of fully plant based food supply   
3. Full automation of medical care   
4. Fully automated state of the art defence and stealth system   
5. Full commitment to acceptance to all refuging artists in the idea from the chapter "ultimate".
   
Currently the world is focussing on point 4, and the most simple way to survive a nuclear winter is inside a nuclear submarine, which might be inspired by the mythos of "Ark Noah".
The world needs point 3, but it will be the last to be automated, since it requires a lot of commitment to build it.
Point 2 has been already implemented to a limited degree, and it has the most potential for everyone to attempt to improve.
Point 1 has been attempted, but for short term solar panel might suffice with enough batteries.

Regarding point 5, there might be a case that there is a last person to be admitted as a refuge.
To ensure the well being of that person, there will be a need for a civilization reaching the least critical mass necessary to naturally repopulate  a planet, in case all the fail safes of the technology has failed. Considering the drastic decline in overall birthrate, a full commitment would imply an fully artificial womb for humans. No one should be forced to contribute to the genepool of humanity, but the future humanity will gratiously accept the donation. Since infant humans cannot survive without care, there would be a need for an artificial nanny robot, in case all other humans has extinguished.
This document was written to convay a mantra in the hope to prevent a dystopia as exemplified in the movie "I am mother":   
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
