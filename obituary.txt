As it has already been realized:
"Pain is only bearable if we know it will end, not if we deny it exists."
Thus those in pain might be confronted with the finitude of ones own life.
Those who seek such confrontation to face it might find an inspiration in these words:
"What does not kill me, makes me stronger."
Those who seek such strength might appreciate these words to stay committed to confront that fear:
"I am gonna do this, even if it costs me my life."
Those who feel stuck after such commitment might appreciate these words:
"What is the progress that i make what my mind thinks that it is a mistake."
Those who cannot figure out what such mistake might be, might realize it through these words:
"The fear of death follows from the fear of life.
A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time."
Those who seek to prepare oneself for one's own final day might appreciate the advice to minimize the dependence to oneself through sufficienct documentation and training for one's successor. Those who do not know what to document, might find an inspiration for a simple way to prepare as the author did by wishing to mention only the following line in the obituary of the author:
"We are all on the way to Pro."
